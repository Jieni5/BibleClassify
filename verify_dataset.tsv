Matthew	He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
Matthew	Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.
Matthew	And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
Matthew	And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.
Matthew	And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.
Matthew	Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,
Matthew	Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.
Matthew	Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.
Matthew	Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make [it] as sure as ye can.
Matthew	So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.
Matthew	In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first [day] of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
Matthew	And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
Matthew	His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:
Matthew	And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead [men].

Matthew	And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.

Matthew	And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail.
Matthew	And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.
Matthew	Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.
Matthew	Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.
Matthew	And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,
Matthew	Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him [away] while we slept.

Matthew	Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, [even] unto the end of the world.
Matthew	Amen.
Mark	And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art [one] of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth [thereto].

Mark	And the second time the cock crew.
Mark	And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.

Mark	And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried [him] away, and delivered [him] to Pilate.
Mark	And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
Mark	And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest [it].
Mark	And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.
Mark	And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing?
Mark	behold how many things they witness against thee.
Mark	But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.
Mark	Now at [that] feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.
Mark	And there was [one] named Barabbas, [which lay] bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
Mark	And the multitude crying aloud began to desire [him to do] as he had ever done unto them.
Mark	But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
Mark	For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.
Mark	But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.
Mark	And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do [unto him] whom ye call the King of the Jews?
Mark	And they cried out again, Crucify him.
Mark	Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done?
Mark	And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.
Mark	And [so] Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged [him], to be crucified.
Mark	And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.
Mark	And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his [head],
Mark	And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
Mark	And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing [their] knees worshipped him.
Mark	And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.
Mark	And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.
Mark	And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
Mark	And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received [it] not.
Mark	And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
Mark	And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
Mark	And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Mark	And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
Mark	And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.
Mark	And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest [it] in three days,
Mark	Save thyself, and come down from the cross.
Mark	Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
Mark	Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe.
Mark	And they that were crucified with him reviled him.
Mark	And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
Mark	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?
Mark	which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
Mark	And some of them that stood by, when they heard [it], said, Behold, he calleth Elias.
Mark	And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put [it] on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.
Mark	And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
Mark	And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
Mark	And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
Mark	There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
Mark	(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.
Mark	And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
Mark	Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counseller, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.
Mark	And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling [unto him] the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.
Mark	And when he knew [it] of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
Mark	And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.
Mark	And Mary Magdalene and Mary [the mother] of Joses beheld where he was laid.
Mark	And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the [mother] of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.
Mark	And very early in the morning the first [day] of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.
Mark	And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?
Mark	And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.
Mark	And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.
Mark	And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.
Mark	But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.
Mark	And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any [man]; for they were afraid.
Mark	Now when [Jesus] was risen early the first [day] of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.
Mark	[And] she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
Mark	And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.
Mark	After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.
Mark	And they went and told [it] unto the residue: neither believed they them.
Mark	Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.
Mark	And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
Mark	He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.
Mark	And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
Mark	They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
Mark	So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.
Mark	And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with [them], and confirming the word with signs following.
Mark	Amen.
Luke	And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.
Luke	And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
Luke	And I answered, Who art thou, Lord?
Luke	And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
Luke	And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.
Luke	And I said, What shall I do, Lord?
Luke	And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.
Luke	And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.
Luke	And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt [there],
Luke	Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight.
Luke	And the same hour I looked up upon him.
Luke	And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.
Luke	For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.
Luke	And now why tarriest thou?
Luke	arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
Luke	And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;
Luke	And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.
Luke	And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:
Luke	And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.
Luke	And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.
Luke	And they gave him audience unto this word, and [then] lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a [fellow] from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.
Luke	And as they cried out, and cast off [their] clothes, and threw dust into the air,
Luke	The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.
Luke	And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
Luke	When the centurion heard [that], he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.
Luke	Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman?
Luke	He said, Yea.
Luke	And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom.
Luke	And Paul said, But I was [free] born.
Luke	Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
Luke	On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from [his] bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.
Luke	And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men [and] brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.
Luke	And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.
Luke	Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, [thou] whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?
Luke	And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God’s high priest?
Luke	Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.
Luke	But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men [and] brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.
Luke	And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.
Luke	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.
Luke	And there arose a great cry: and the scribes [that were] of the Pharisees’ part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.
Luke	And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring [him] into the castle.
Luke	And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.
Luke	And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
Luke	And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.
Luke	And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.
Luke	Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.
Luke	And when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.
Luke	Then Paul called one of the centurions unto [him], and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.
Luke	So he took him, and brought [him] to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto [him], and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.
Luke	Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went [with him] aside privately, and asked [him], What is that thou hast to tell me?
Luke	And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly.
Luke	But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.
Luke	So the chief captain [then] let the young man depart, and charged [him, See thou] tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.
Luke	And he called unto [him] two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;
Luke	And provide [them] beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring [him] safe unto Felix the governor.
Luke	And he wrote a letter after this manner:
Luke	Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix [sendeth] greeting.
Luke	This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.
Luke	And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:
Luke	Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.
Luke	And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what [they had] against him.
Luke	Farewell.
Luke	Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought [him] by night to Antipatris.
Luke	On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:
Luke	Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.
Luke	And when the governor had read [the letter], he asked of what province he was.
Luke	And when he understood that [he was] of Cilicia;
Luke	I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come.
Luke	And he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s judgment hall.
Luke	And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and [with] a certain orator [named] Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.
Luke	And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse [him], saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,
Luke	We accept [it] always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.
Luke	Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.
Luke	For we have found this man [a] pestilent [fellow], and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:
Luke	Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.
Luke	But the chief captain Lysias came [upon us], and with great violence took [him] away out of our hands,
Luke	Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.
Luke	And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.
Luke	Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:
Luke	Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.
Luke	And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:
Luke	Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.
Luke	But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:
Luke	And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.
Luke	And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and [toward] men.
Luke	Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.
Luke	Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.
Luke	Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.
Luke	Or else let these same [here] say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,
Luke	Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.
Luke	And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of [that] way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.
Luke	And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let [him] have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.
Luke	And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
Luke	And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.
Luke	He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.
Luke	But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix’ room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.
Luke	Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.
Luke	Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,
Luke	And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.
Luke	But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly [thither].
Luke	Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with [me], and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.
Luke	And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.
Luke	And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.
Luke	While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.
Luke	But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?
Luke	Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.
Luke	For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them.
Luke	I appeal unto Caesar.
Luke	Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar?
Luke	unto Caesar shalt thou go.
Luke	And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.
Luke	And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:
Luke	About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed [me], desiring [to have] judgment against him.
Luke	To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.
Luke	Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.
Luke	Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:
Luke	But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
Luke	And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked [him] whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.
Luke	But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.
Luke	Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself.
Luke	To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.
Luke	And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus’ commandment Paul was brought forth.
Luke	And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and [also] here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.
Luke	But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.
Luke	Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord.
Luke	Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.
Luke	For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes [laid] against him.
Luke	Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself.
Luke	Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:
Luke	I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:
Luke	Especially [because I know] thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.
Luke	My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;
Luke	Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
Luke	And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:
Luke	Unto which [promise] our twelve tribes, instantly serving [God] day and night, hope to come.
Luke	For which hope’s sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.
Luke	Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?
Luke	I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
Luke	Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against [them].
Luke	And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled [them] to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted [them] even unto strange cities.
Luke	Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,
Luke	At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.
Luke	And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
Luke	[it is] hard for thee to kick against the pricks.
Luke	And I said, Who art thou, Lord?
Luke	And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.
Luke	But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;
Luke	Delivering thee from the people, and [from] the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,
Luke	To open their eyes, [and] to turn [them] from darkness to light, and [from] the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.
Luke	Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:
Luke	But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and [then] to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.
Luke	For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill [me].
Luke	Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:
Luke	That Christ should suffer, [and] that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.
Luke	And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.
Luke	But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.
Luke	For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.
Luke	King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets?
Luke	I know that thou believest.
Luke	Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.
Luke	And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.
Luke	And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:
Luke	And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
Luke	Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.
Luke	And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto [one] named Julius, a centurion of Augustus’ band.
Luke	And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; [one] Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
Luke	And the next [day] we touched at Sidon.
Luke	And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave [him] liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.
Luke	And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
Luke	And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, [a city] of Lycia.
Luke	And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.
Luke	And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;
Luke	And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city [of] Lasea.
Luke	Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished [them],
Luke	And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.
Luke	Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.
Luke	And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, [and there] to winter; [which is] an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.
Luke	And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained [their] purpose, loosing [thence], they sailed close by Crete.
Luke	But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.
Luke	And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let [her] drive.
Luke	And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:
Luke	Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.
Luke	And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next [day] they lightened the ship;
Luke	And the third [day] we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.
Luke	And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on [us], all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.
Luke	But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.
Luke	And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of [any man’s] life among you, but of the ship.
Luke	For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,
Luke	Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.
Luke	Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.
Luke	Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.
Luke	But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;
Luke	And sounded, and found [it] twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found [it] fifteen fathoms.
Luke	Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.
Luke	And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,
Luke	Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.
Luke	Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
Luke	And while the day was coming on, Paul besought [them] all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.
Luke	Wherefore I pray you to take [some] meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.
Luke	And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken [it], he began to eat.
Luke	Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took [some] meat.
Luke	And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.
Luke	And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.
Luke	And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.
Luke	And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed [themselves] unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.
Luke	And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.
Luke	And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.
Luke	But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from [their] purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast [themselves] first [into the sea], and get to land:
Luke	And the rest, some on boards, and some on [broken pieces] of the ship.
Luke	And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.
Luke	And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.
Luke	And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
Luke	And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid [them] on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
Luke	And when the barbarians saw the [venomous] beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.
Luke	And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.
Luke	Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
Luke	In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.
Luke	And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.
Luke	So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:
Luke	Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded [us] with such things as were necessary.
Luke	And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.
Luke	And landing at Syracuse, we tarried [there] three days.
Luke	And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:
Luke	Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.
Luke	And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.
Luke	And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.
Luke	And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men [and] brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
Luke	Who, when they had examined me, would have let [me] go, because there was no cause of death in me.
Luke	But when the Jews spake against [it], I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.
Luke	For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see [you], and to speak with [you]: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
Luke	And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.
Luke	But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.
Luke	And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into [his] lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and [out of] the prophets, from morning till evening.
Luke	And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.
Luke	And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,
Luke	Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:
Luke	For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with [their] eyes, and hear with [their] ears, and understand with [their] heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
Luke	Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and [that] they will hear it.
Luke	And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.
Luke	And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,
Luke	Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.
John	And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous [are] thy judgments.
John	And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.
John	And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.
John	And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,
John	And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.
John	And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.
John	And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs [come] out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
John	For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, [which] go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.
John	Behold, I come as a thief.
John	Blessed [is] he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.
John	And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.
John	And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.
John	And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, [and] so great.
John	And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.
John	And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
John	And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, [every stone] about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.
John	And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:
John	With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.
John	So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
John	And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:
John	And upon her forehead [was] a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
John	And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.
John	And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel?
John	I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.
John	The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.
John	And here [is] the mind which hath wisdom.
John	The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.
John	And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, [and] the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.
John	And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.
John	And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.
John	These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.
John	These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him [are] called, and chosen, and faithful.
John	And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
John	And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.
John	For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.
John	And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.
John	And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.
John	And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.
John	For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.
John	And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.
John	For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.
John	Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.
John	How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.
John	Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong [is] the Lord God who judgeth her.
John	And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,
John	Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city!
John	for in one hour is thy judgment come.
John	And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:
John	The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,
John	And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.
John	And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.
John	The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,
John	And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!
John	For in one hour so great riches is come to nought.
John	And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,
John	And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What [city is] like unto this great city!
John	And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness!
John	for in one hour is she made desolate.
John	Rejoice over her, [thou] heaven, and [ye] holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.
John	And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast [it] into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.
John	And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft [he be], shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;
John	And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.
John	And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.
John	And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:
John	For true and righteous [are] his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.
John	And again they said, Alleluia.
John	And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.
John	And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.
John	And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.
John	And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.
John	Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.
John	And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.
John	And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed [are] they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.
John	And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.
John	And I fell at his feet to worship him.
John	And he said unto me, See [thou do it] not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
John	And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him [was] called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.
John	His eyes [were] as a flame of fire, and on his head [were] many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.
John	And he [was] clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.
John	And the armies [which were] in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
John	And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.
John	And he hath on [his] vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.
John	And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;
John	That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all [men, both] free and bond, both small and great.
John	And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.
John	And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image.
John	These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.
John	And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which [sword] proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.
John	And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
John	And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
John	And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.
John	And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and [I saw] the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received [his] mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
John	But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.
John	This [is] the first resurrection.
John	Blessed and holy [is] he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
John	And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,
John	And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom [is] as the sand of the sea.
John	And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
John	And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [are], and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
John	And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
John	And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is [the book] of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
John	And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
John	And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire.
John	This is the second death.
John	And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
John	And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.
John	And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
John	And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God [is] with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, [and be] their God.
John	And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.
John	And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.
John	And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.
John	And he said unto me, It is done.
John	I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.
John	I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.
John	He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
John	But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.
John	And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife.
John	And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,
John	Having the glory of God: and her light [was] like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;
John	And had a wall great and high, [and] had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are [the names] of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:
John	On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
John	And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
John	And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.
John	And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs.
John	The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
John	And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred [and] forty [and] four cubits, [according to] the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.
John	And the building of the wall of it was [of] jasper: and the city [was] pure gold, like unto clear glass.
John	And the foundations of the wall of the city [were] garnished with all manner of precious stones.
John	The first foundation [was] jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;
John	The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.
John	And the twelve gates [were] twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city [was] pure gold, as it were transparent glass.
John	And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.
John	And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb [is] the light thereof.
John	And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.
John	And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.
John	And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.
John	And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither [whatsoever] worketh abomination, or [maketh] a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.
John	And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.
John	In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, [was there] the tree of life, which bare twelve [manner of] fruits, [and] yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree [were] for the healing of the nations.
John	And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:
John	And they shall see his face; and his name [shall be] in their foreheads.
John	And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.
John	And he said unto me, These sayings [are] faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.
John	Behold, I come quickly: blessed [is] he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.
John	And I John saw these things, and heard [them].
John	And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things.
John	Then saith he unto me, See [thou do it] not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.
John	And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.
John	He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.
John	And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward [is] with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.
John	I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.
John	Blessed [are] they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.
John	For without [are] dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.
John	I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches.
John	I am the root and the offspring of David, [and] the bright and morning star.
John	And the Spirit and the bride say, Come.
John	And let him that heareth say, Come.
John	And let him that is athirst come.
John	And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.
John	For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:
John	And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and [from] the things which are written in this book.
John	He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly.
John	Amen.
John	Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
John	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all.
John	Amen.
Paul	As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all [men], especially unto them who are of the household of faith.
Paul	Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.
Paul	As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
Paul	For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
Paul	But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
Paul	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
Paul	And as many as walk according to this rule, peace [be] on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
Paul	From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
Paul	Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit.
Paul	Amen.
Paul	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:
Paul	Grace [be] to you, and peace, from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.
Paul	Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly [places] in Christ:
Paul	According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:
Paul	Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
Paul	To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.
Paul	In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;
Paul	Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;
Paul	Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:
Paul	That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; [even] in him:
Paul	In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:
Paul	That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.
Paul	In whom ye also [trusted], after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,
Paul	Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.
Paul	Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,
Paul	Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;
Paul	That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:
Paul	The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
Paul	And what [is] the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,
Paul	Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set [him] at his own right hand in the heavenly [places],
Paul	Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:
Paul	And hath put all [things] under his feet, and gave him [to be] the head over all [things] to the church,
Paul	Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.
Paul	And you [hath he quickened], who were dead in trespasses and sins;
Paul	Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:
Paul	Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
Paul	But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
Paul	Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)
Paul	And hath raised [us] up together, and made [us] sit together in heavenly [places] in Christ Jesus:
Paul	That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in [his] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
Paul	For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift of God:
Paul	Not of works, lest any man should boast.
Paul	For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.
Paul	Wherefore remember, that ye [being] in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;
Paul	That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:
Paul	But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
Paul	For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition [between us];
Paul	Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, [even] the law of commandments [contained] in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, [so] making peace;
Paul	And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:
Paul	And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.
Paul	For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
Paul	Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;
Paul	And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner [stone];
Paul	In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:
Paul	In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.
Paul	For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,
Paul	If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:
Paul	How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,
Paul	Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)
Paul	Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;
Paul	That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:
Paul	Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.
Paul	Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;
Paul	And to make all [men] see what [is] the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:
Paul	To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly [places] might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,
Paul	According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
Paul	In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.
Paul	Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.
Paul	For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
Paul	Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,
Paul	That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;
Paul	That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,
Paul	May be able to comprehend with all saints what [is] the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;
Paul	And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.
Paul	Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,
Paul	Unto him [be] glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end.
Paul	Amen.
Paul	I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,
Paul	With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;
Paul	Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
Paul	[There is] one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;
Paul	One Lord, one faith, one baptism,
Paul	One God and Father of all, who [is] above all, and through all, and in you all.
Paul	But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
Paul	Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.
Paul	(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?
Paul	He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)
Paul	And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
Paul	For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:
Paul	Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
Paul	That we [henceforth] be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, [and] cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;
Paul	But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, [even] Christ:
Paul	From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.
Paul	This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,
Paul	Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:
Paul	Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.
Paul	But ye have not so learned Christ;
Paul	If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:
Paul	That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;
Paul	And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;
Paul	And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.
Paul	Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.
Paul	Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:
Paul	Neither give place to the devil.
Paul	Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with [his] hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.
Paul	Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.
Paul	And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.
Paul	Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:
Paul	And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.
Paul	Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;
Paul	And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.
Paul	But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
Paul	Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.
Paul	For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
Paul	Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
Paul	Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
Paul	For ye were sometimes darkness, but now [are ye] light in the Lord: walk as children of light:
Paul	(For the fruit of the Spirit [is] in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)
Paul	Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.
Paul	And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove [them].
Paul	For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.
Paul	But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.
Paul	Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
Paul	See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
Paul	Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
Paul	Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord [is].
Paul	And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;
Paul	Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;
Paul	Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
Paul	Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.
Paul	Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.
Paul	For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.
Paul	Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so [let] the wives [be] to their own husbands in every thing.
Paul	Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;
Paul	That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
Paul	That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
Paul	So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies.
Paul	He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
Paul	For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:
Paul	For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
Paul	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
Paul	This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
Paul	Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife [see] that she reverence [her] husband.
Paul	Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
Paul	Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)
Paul	That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.
Paul	And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
Paul	Servants, be obedient to them that are [your] masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;
Paul	Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;
Paul	With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:
Paul	Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether [he be] bond or free.
Paul	And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.
Paul	Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
Paul	Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
Paul	For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high [places].
Paul	Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
Paul	Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;
Paul	And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
Paul	Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
Paul	And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
Paul	Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;
Paul	And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,
Paul	For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
Paul	But that ye also may know my affairs, [and] how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:
Paul	Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and [that] he might comfort your hearts.
Paul	Peace [be] to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Paul	Grace [be] with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.
Paul	Amen.
Peter	Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,
Peter	And saying, Where is the promise of his coming?
Peter	for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as [they were] from the beginning of the creation.
Peter	For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:
Peter	Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:
Peter	But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.
Peter	But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day [is] with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
Peter	The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
Peter	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
Peter	[Seeing] then [that] all these things shall be dissolved, what manner [of persons] ought ye to be in [all] holy conversation and godliness,
Peter	Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?
Peter	Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
Peter	Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.
Peter	And account [that] the longsuffering of our Lord [is] salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;
Peter	As also in all [his] epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as [they do] also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.
Peter	Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know [these things] before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.
Peter	But grow in grace, and [in] the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
Peter	To him [be] glory both now and for ever.
Peter	Amen.
James	But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and [your] nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.
James	Is any among you afflicted?
James	let him pray.
James	Is any merry?
James	let him sing psalms.
James	Is any sick among you?
James	let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
James	And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.
James	Confess [your] faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed.
James	The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.
James	Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.
James	And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.
James	Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;
James	Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.
Jude	Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present [you] faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,
Jude	To the only wise God our Saviour, [be] glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever.
Jude	Amen.
