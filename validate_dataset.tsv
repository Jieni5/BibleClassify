Matthew	Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?
Matthew	Blessed [is] that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.
Matthew	Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.
Matthew	But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;
Matthew	And shall begin to smite [his] fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;
Matthew	The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for [him], and in an hour that he is not aware of,
Matthew	And shall cut him asunder, and appoint [him] his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew	Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
Matthew	And five of them were wise, and five [were] foolish.
Matthew	They that [were] foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
Matthew	But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
Matthew	While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
Matthew	And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
Matthew	Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
Matthew	And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
Matthew	But the wise answered, saying, [Not so]; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
Matthew	And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.
Matthew	Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
Matthew	But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
Matthew	Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.
Matthew	For [the kingdom of heaven is] as a man travelling into a far country, [who] called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
Matthew	And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.
Matthew	Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made [them] other five talents.
Matthew	And likewise he that [had received] two, he also gained other two.
Matthew	But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.
Matthew	After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.
Matthew	And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.
Matthew	His lord said unto him, Well done, [thou] good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
Matthew	He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.
Matthew	His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
Matthew	Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:
Matthew	And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, [there] thou hast [that is] thine.
Matthew	His lord answered and said unto him, [Thou] wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:
Matthew	Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and [then] at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.
Matthew	Take therefore the talent from him, and give [it] unto him which hath ten talents.
Matthew	For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.
Matthew	And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew	When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:
Matthew	And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth [his] sheep from the goats:
Matthew	And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
Matthew	Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
Matthew	For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:
Matthew	Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
Matthew	Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed [thee]?
Matthew	or thirsty, and gave [thee] drink?
Matthew	When saw we thee a stranger, and took [thee] in?
Matthew	or naked, and clothed [thee]?
Matthew	Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
Matthew	And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done [it] unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done [it] unto me.
Matthew	Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
Matthew	For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:
Matthew	I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
Matthew	Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
Matthew	Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did [it] not to one of the least of these, ye did [it] not to me.
Matthew	And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
Matthew	And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,
Matthew	Ye know that after two days is [the feast of] the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.
Matthew	Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
Matthew	And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill [him].
Matthew	But they said, Not on the feast [day], lest there be an uproar among the people.
Matthew	Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
Matthew	There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat [at meat].
Matthew	But when his disciples saw [it], they had indignation, saying, To what purpose [is] this waste?
Matthew	For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
Matthew	When Jesus understood [it], he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman?
Matthew	for she hath wrought a good work upon me.
Matthew	For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.
Matthew	For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did [it] for my burial.
Matthew	Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, [there] shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.
Matthew	Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,
Matthew	And said [unto them], What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you?
Matthew	And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.
Matthew	And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
Matthew	Now the first [day] of the [feast of] unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
Matthew	And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.
Matthew	And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.
Matthew	Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.
Matthew	And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
Matthew	And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?
Matthew	And he answered and said, He that dippeth [his] hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.
Matthew	The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed!
Matthew	it had been good for that man if he had not been born.
Matthew	Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I?
Matthew	He said unto him, Thou hast said.
Matthew	And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed [it], and brake [it], and gave [it] to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.
Matthew	And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave [it] to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;
Matthew	For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
Matthew	But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.
Matthew	And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
Matthew	Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.
Matthew	But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.
Matthew	Peter answered and said unto him, Though all [men] shall be offended because of thee, [yet] will I never be offended.
Matthew	Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
Matthew	Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee.
Matthew	Likewise also said all the disciples.
Matthew	Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.
Matthew	And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
Matthew	Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.
Matthew	And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou [wilt].
Matthew	And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?
Matthew	Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed [is] willing, but the flesh [is] weak.
Matthew	He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.
Matthew	And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.
Matthew	And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.
Matthew	Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take [your] rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Matthew	Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.
Matthew	And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
Matthew	Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.
Matthew	And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.
Matthew	And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come?
Matthew	Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.
Matthew	And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out [his] hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s, and smote off his ear.
Matthew	Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.
Matthew	Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?
Matthew	But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
Matthew	In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me?
Matthew	I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.
Matthew	But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.
Matthew	Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
Matthew	And they that had laid hold on Jesus led [him] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
Matthew	But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.
Matthew	Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;
Matthew	But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, [yet] found they none.
Matthew	At the last came two false witnesses,
Matthew	And said, This [fellow] said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.
Matthew	And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing?
Matthew	what [is it which] these witness against thee?
Matthew	But Jesus held his peace.
Matthew	And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.
Matthew	Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
Matthew	Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses?
Matthew	behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.
Matthew	What think ye?
Matthew	They answered and said, He is guilty of death.
Matthew	Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote [him] with the palms of their hands,
Matthew	Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?
Matthew	Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.
Matthew	But he denied before [them] all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.
Matthew	And when he was gone out into the porch, another [maid] saw him, and said unto them that were there, This [fellow] was also with Jesus of Nazareth.
Matthew	And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
Matthew	And after a while came unto [him] they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art [one] of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.
Matthew	Then began he to curse and to swear, [saying], I know not the man.
Matthew	And immediately the cock crew.
Matthew	And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
Matthew	And he went out, and wept bitterly.
Matthew	When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:
Matthew	And when they had bound him, they led [him] away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
Matthew	Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
Matthew	Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood.
Matthew	And they said, What [is that] to us?
Matthew	see thou [to that].
Matthew	And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.
Matthew	And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.
Matthew	And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.
Matthew	Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.
Matthew	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;
Matthew	And gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.
Matthew	And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews?
Matthew	And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.
Matthew	And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.
Matthew	Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?
Matthew	And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.
Matthew	Now at [that] feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.
Matthew	And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
Matthew	Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you?
Matthew	Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?
Matthew	For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.
Matthew	When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.
Matthew	But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
Matthew	The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you?
Matthew	They said, Barabbas.
Matthew	Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ?
Matthew	[They] all say unto him, Let him be crucified.
Matthew	And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done?
Matthew	But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.
Matthew	When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but [that] rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed [his] hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye [to it].
Matthew	Then answered all the people, and said, His blood [be] on us, and on our children.
Matthew	Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered [him] to be crucified.
Matthew	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band [of soldiers].
Matthew	And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
Matthew	And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put [it] upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
Matthew	And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.
Matthew	And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify [him].
Matthew	And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.
Matthew	And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,
Matthew	They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted [thereof], he would not drink.
Matthew	And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.
Matthew	And sitting down they watched him there;
Matthew	And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Matthew	Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.
Matthew	And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,
Matthew	And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest [it] in three days, save thyself.
Matthew	If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.
Matthew	Likewise also the chief priests mocking [him], with the scribes and elders, said,
Matthew	He saved others; himself he cannot save.
Matthew	If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.
Matthew	He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.
Matthew	The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.
Matthew	Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.
Matthew	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?
Matthew	that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
Matthew	Some of them that stood there, when they heard [that], said, This [man] calleth for Elias.
Matthew	And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled [it] with vinegar, and put [it] on a reed, and gave him to drink.
Matthew	The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.
Matthew	Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.
Matthew	And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;
Matthew	And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,
Matthew	And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.
Matthew	Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.
Matthew	And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:
Matthew	Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children.
Matthew	When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:
Matthew	He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
Matthew	Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.
Matthew	And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
Matthew	And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.
Matthew	And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.
Matthew	Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,
Matthew	Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.
Matthew	Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.
Matthew	Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make [it] as sure as ye can.
Matthew	So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.
Matthew	In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first [day] of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
Matthew	And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
Matthew	His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:
Matthew	And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead [men].
Matthew	And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.
Matthew	He is not here: for he is risen, as he said.
Matthew	Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
Matthew	And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.
Matthew	And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.
Matthew	And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail.
Matthew	And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.
Matthew	Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.
Matthew	Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.
Matthew	And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,
Matthew	Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him [away] while we slept.
Matthew	And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.
Matthew	So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.
Matthew	Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
Matthew	And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.
Matthew	And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
Matthew	Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
Matthew	Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, [even] unto the end of the world.
Matthew	Amen.
Mark	For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor.
Mark	And they murmured against her.
Mark	And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her?
Mark	she hath wrought a good work on me.
Mark	For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.
Mark	She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.
Mark	Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, [this] also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.
Mark	And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.
Mark	And when they heard [it], they were glad, and promised to give him money.
Mark	And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.
Mark	And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?
Mark	And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.
Mark	And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
Mark	And he will shew you a large upper room furnished [and] prepared: there make ready for us.
Mark	And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
Mark	And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.
Mark	And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.
Mark	And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, [Is] it I?
Mark	and another [said, Is] it I?
Mark	And he answered and said unto them, [It is] one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.
Mark	The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed!
Mark	good were it for that man if he had never been born.
Mark	And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake [it], and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.
Mark	And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave [it] to them: and they all drank of it.
Mark	And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.
Mark	Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.
Mark	And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
Mark	And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.
Mark	But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
Mark	But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet [will] not I.
Mark	And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, [even] in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.
Mark	But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise.
Mark	Likewise also said they all.
Mark	And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.
Mark	And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;
Mark	And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.
Mark	And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
Mark	And he said, Abba, Father, all things [are] possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.
Mark	And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou?
Mark	couldest not thou watch one hour?
Mark	Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.
Mark	The spirit truly [is] ready, but the flesh [is] weak.
Mark	And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.
Mark	And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.
Mark	And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take [your] rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Mark	Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.
Mark	And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
Mark	And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead [him] away safely.
Mark	And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.
Mark	And they laid their hands on him, and took him.
Mark	And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
Mark	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and [with] staves to take me?
Mark	I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.
Mark	And they all forsook him, and fled.
Mark	And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about [his] naked [body]; and the young men laid hold on him:
Mark	And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
Mark	And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.
Mark	And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.
Mark	And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.
Mark	For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.
Mark	And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,
Mark	We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.
Mark	But neither so did their witness agree together.
Mark	And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing?
Mark	what [is it which] these witness against thee?
Mark	But he held his peace, and answered nothing.
Mark	Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?
Mark	And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
Mark	Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?
Mark	Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye?
Mark	And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.
Mark	And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.
Mark	And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:
Mark	And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.
Mark	But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest.
Mark	And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.
Mark	And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is [one] of them.
Mark	And he denied it again.
Mark	And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art [one] of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth [thereto].
Mark	But he began to curse and to swear, [saying], I know not this man of whom ye speak.
Mark	And the second time the cock crew.
Mark	And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.
Mark	And when he thought thereon, he wept.
Mark	And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried [him] away, and delivered [him] to Pilate.
Mark	And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
Mark	And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest [it].
Mark	And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.
Mark	And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing?
Mark	behold how many things they witness against thee.
Mark	But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.
Mark	Now at [that] feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.
Mark	And there was [one] named Barabbas, [which lay] bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
Mark	And the multitude crying aloud began to desire [him to do] as he had ever done unto them.
Mark	But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
Mark	For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.
Mark	But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.
Mark	And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do [unto him] whom ye call the King of the Jews?
Mark	And they cried out again, Crucify him.
Mark	Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done?
Mark	And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.
Mark	And [so] Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged [him], to be crucified.
Mark	And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.
Mark	And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his [head],
Mark	And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
Mark	And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing [their] knees worshipped him.
Mark	And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.
Mark	And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.
Mark	And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
Mark	And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received [it] not.
Mark	And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
Mark	And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
Mark	And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Mark	And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
Mark	And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.
Mark	And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest [it] in three days,
Mark	Save thyself, and come down from the cross.
Mark	Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
Mark	Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe.
Mark	And they that were crucified with him reviled him.
Mark	And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
Mark	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?
Mark	which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
Mark	And some of them that stood by, when they heard [it], said, Behold, he calleth Elias.
Mark	And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put [it] on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.
Mark	And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
Mark	And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
Mark	And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
Mark	There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
Mark	(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.
Mark	And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
Mark	Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counseller, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.
Mark	And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling [unto him] the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.
Mark	And when he knew [it] of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
Mark	And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.
Mark	And Mary Magdalene and Mary [the mother] of Joses beheld where he was laid.
Mark	And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the [mother] of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.
Mark	And very early in the morning the first [day] of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.
Mark	And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?
Mark	And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.
Mark	And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.
Mark	And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.
Mark	But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.
Mark	And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any [man]; for they were afraid.
Mark	Now when [Jesus] was risen early the first [day] of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.
Mark	[And] she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
Mark	And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.
Mark	After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.
Mark	And they went and told [it] unto the residue: neither believed they them.
Mark	Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.
Mark	And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
Mark	He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.
Mark	And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
Mark	They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
Mark	So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.
Mark	And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with [them], and confirming the word with signs following.
Mark	Amen.
Luke	And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.
Luke	And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.
Luke	Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,
Luke	After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.
Luke	And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.
Luke	And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.
Luke	And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.
Luke	Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next [day] to Neapolis;
Luke	And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, [and] a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.
Luke	And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted [thither].
Luke	And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard [us]: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.
Luke	And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought [us], saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide [there].
Luke	And she constrained us.
Luke	And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:
Luke	The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.
Luke	And this did she many days.
Luke	But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.
Luke	And he came out the same hour.
Luke	And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew [them] into the marketplace unto the rulers,
Luke	And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,
Luke	And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.
Luke	And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat [them].
Luke	And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast [them] into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:
Luke	Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
Luke	And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.
Luke	And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed.
Luke	And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.
Luke	But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.
Luke	Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,
Luke	And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
Luke	And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.
Luke	And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.
Luke	And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed [their] stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.
Luke	And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.
Luke	And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.
Luke	And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.
Luke	But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast [us] into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily?
Luke	nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.
Luke	And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.
Luke	And they came and besought them, and brought [them] out, and desired [them] to depart out of the city.
Luke	And they went out of the prison, and entered into [the house of] Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.
Luke	Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:
Luke	And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,
Luke	Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.
Luke	And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.
Luke	But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.
Luke	And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;
Luke	Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, [one] Jesus.
Luke	And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.
Luke	And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.
Luke	And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming [thither] went into the synagogue of the Jews.
Luke	These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.
Luke	Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.
Luke	But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.
Luke	And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.
Luke	And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.
Luke	Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.
Luke	Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.
Luke	Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him.
Luke	And some said, What will this babbler say?
Luke	other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.
Luke	And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, [is]?
Luke	For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.
Luke	(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)
Luke	Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, and said, [Ye] men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.
Luke	For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.
Luke	Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.
Luke	God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
Luke	Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
Luke	And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
Luke	That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:
Luke	For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.
Luke	Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man’s device.
Luke	And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:
Luke	Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by [that] man whom he hath ordained; [whereof] he hath given assurance unto all [men], in that he hath raised him from the dead.
Luke	And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this [matter].
Luke	So Paul departed from among them.
Luke	Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which [was] Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
Luke	After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;
Luke	And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.
Luke	And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.
Luke	And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.
Luke	And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews [that] Jesus [was] Christ.
Luke	And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook [his] raiment, and said unto them, Your blood [be] upon your own heads; I [am] clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.
Luke	And he departed thence, and entered into a certain [man’s] house, named Justus, [one] that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.
Luke	And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.
Luke	Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:
Luke	For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.
Luke	And he continued [there] a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
Luke	And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,
Luke	Saying, This [fellow] persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.
Luke	And when Paul was now about to open [his] mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O [ye] Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:
Luke	But if it be a question of words and names, and [of] your law, look ye [to it]; for I will be no judge of such [matters].
Luke	And he drave them from the judgment seat.
Luke	Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat [him] before the judgment seat.
Luke	And Gallio cared for none of those things.
Luke	And Paul [after this] tarried [there] yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn [his] head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.
Luke	And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.
Luke	When they desired [him] to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;
Luke	But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will.
Luke	And he sailed from Ephesus.
Luke	And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.
Luke	And after he had spent some time [there], he departed, and went over [all] the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.
Luke	And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, [and] mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.
Luke	This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.
Luke	And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto [them], and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.
Luke	And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:
Luke	For he mightily convinced the Jews, [and that] publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.
Luke	And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,
Luke	He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?
Luke	And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.
Luke	And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized?
Luke	And they said, Unto John’s baptism.
Luke	Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.
Luke	When they heard [this], they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
Luke	And when Paul had laid [his] hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.
Luke	And all the men were about twelve.
Luke	And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.
Luke	But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.
Luke	And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
Luke	And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:
Luke	So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.
Luke	Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.
Luke	And there were seven sons of [one] Sceva, a Jew, [and] chief of the priests, which did so.
Luke	And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?
Luke	And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
Luke	And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
Luke	And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.
Luke	Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all [men]: and they counted the price of them, and found [it] fifty thousand [pieces] of silver.
Luke	So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.
Luke	After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.
Luke	So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.
Luke	And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.
Luke	For a certain [man] named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;
Luke	Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.
Luke	Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:
Luke	So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.
Luke	And when they heard [these sayings], they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great [is] Diana of the Ephesians.
Luke	And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.
Luke	And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.
Luke	And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring [him] that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.
Luke	Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.
Luke	And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward.
Luke	And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.
Luke	But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great [is] Diana of the Ephesians.
Luke	And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, [Ye] men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the [image] which fell down from Jupiter?
Luke	Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.
Luke	For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.
Luke	Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.
Luke	But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.
Luke	For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.
Luke	And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
Luke	And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto [him] the disciples, and embraced [them], and departed for to go into Macedonia.
Luke	And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,
Luke	And [there] abode three months.
Luke	And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.
Luke	And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.
Luke	These going before tarried for us at Troas.
Luke	And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.
Luke	And upon the first [day] of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.
Luke	And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.
Luke	And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.
Luke	And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing [him] said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.
Luke	When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.
Luke	And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.
Luke	And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.
Luke	And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.
Luke	And we sailed thence, and came the next [day] over against Chios; and the next [day] we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next [day] we came to Miletus.
Luke	For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.
Luke	And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.
Luke	And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,
Luke	Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:
Luke	[And] how I kept back nothing that was profitable [unto you], but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,
Luke	Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
Luke	And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:
Luke	Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.
Luke	But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
Luke	And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.
Luke	Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I [am] pure from the blood of all [men].
Luke	For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.
Luke	Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.
Luke	For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
Luke	Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.
Luke	Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.
Luke	And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.
Luke	I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.
Luke	Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.
Luke	I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.
Luke	And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.
Luke	And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him,
Luke	Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more.
Luke	And they accompanied him unto the ship.
Luke	And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the [day] following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:
Luke	And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.
Luke	Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.
Luke	And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.
Luke	And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till [we were] out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.
Luke	And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.
Luke	And when we had finished [our] course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.
Luke	And the next [day] we that were of Paul’s company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was [one] of the seven; and abode with him.
Luke	And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.
Luke	And as we tarried [there] many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.
Luke	And when he was come unto us, he took Paul’s girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver [him] into the hands of the Gentiles.
Luke	And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.
Luke	Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?
Luke	for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
Luke	And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.
Luke	And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.
Luke	There went with us also [certain] of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.
Luke	And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
Luke	And the [day] following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.
Luke	And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.
Luke	And when they heard [it], they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:
Luke	And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise [their] children, neither to walk after the customs.
Luke	What is it therefore?
Luke	the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.
Luke	Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;
Luke	Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave [their] heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but [that] thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.
Luke	As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written [and] concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from [things] offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.
Luke	Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.
Luke	And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,
Luke	Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all [men] every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.
Luke	(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)
Luke	And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.
Luke	And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
Luke	Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul.
Luke	Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded [him] to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.
Luke	And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.
Luke	And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.
Luke	For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.
Luke	And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee?
Luke	Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?
Luke	Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?
Luke	But Paul said, I am a man [which am] a Jew of Tarsus, [a city] in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.
Luke	And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people.
Luke	And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto [them] in the Hebrew tongue, saying,
Luke	Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence [which I make] now unto you.
Luke	(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)
Luke	I am verily a man [which am] a Jew, born in Tarsus, [a city] in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, [and] taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.
Luke	And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
Luke	As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.
Luke	And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.
Luke	And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
Luke	And I answered, Who art thou, Lord?
Luke	And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
Luke	And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.
Luke	And I said, What shall I do, Lord?
Luke	And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.
Luke	And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.
Luke	And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt [there],
Luke	Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight.
Luke	And the same hour I looked up upon him.
Luke	And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.
Luke	For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.
Luke	And now why tarriest thou?
Luke	arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
Luke	And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;
Luke	And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.
Luke	And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:
Luke	And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.
Luke	And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.
Luke	And they gave him audience unto this word, and [then] lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a [fellow] from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.
Luke	And as they cried out, and cast off [their] clothes, and threw dust into the air,
Luke	The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.
Luke	And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
Luke	When the centurion heard [that], he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.
Luke	Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman?
Luke	He said, Yea.
Luke	And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom.
Luke	And Paul said, But I was [free] born.
Luke	Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
Luke	On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from [his] bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.
Luke	And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men [and] brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.
Luke	And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.
Luke	Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, [thou] whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?
Luke	And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God’s high priest?
Luke	Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.
Luke	But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men [and] brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.
Luke	And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.
Luke	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.
Luke	And there arose a great cry: and the scribes [that were] of the Pharisees’ part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.
Luke	And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring [him] into the castle.
Luke	And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.
Luke	And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
Luke	And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.
Luke	And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.
Luke	Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.
Luke	And when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.
Luke	Then Paul called one of the centurions unto [him], and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.
Luke	So he took him, and brought [him] to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto [him], and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.
Luke	Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went [with him] aside privately, and asked [him], What is that thou hast to tell me?
Luke	And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly.
Luke	But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.
Luke	So the chief captain [then] let the young man depart, and charged [him, See thou] tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.
Luke	And he called unto [him] two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;
Luke	And provide [them] beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring [him] safe unto Felix the governor.
Luke	And he wrote a letter after this manner:
Luke	Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix [sendeth] greeting.
Luke	This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.
Luke	And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:
Luke	Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.
Luke	And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what [they had] against him.
Luke	Farewell.
Luke	Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought [him] by night to Antipatris.
Luke	On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:
Luke	Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.
Luke	And when the governor had read [the letter], he asked of what province he was.
Luke	And when he understood that [he was] of Cilicia;
Luke	I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come.
Luke	And he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s judgment hall.
Luke	And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and [with] a certain orator [named] Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.
Luke	And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse [him], saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,
Luke	We accept [it] always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.
Luke	Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.
Luke	For we have found this man [a] pestilent [fellow], and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:
Luke	Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.
Luke	But the chief captain Lysias came [upon us], and with great violence took [him] away out of our hands,
Luke	Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.
Luke	And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.
Luke	Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:
Luke	Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.
Luke	And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:
Luke	Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.
Luke	But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:
Luke	And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.
Luke	And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and [toward] men.
Luke	Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.
Luke	Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.
Luke	Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.
Luke	Or else let these same [here] say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,
Luke	Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.
Luke	And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of [that] way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.
Luke	And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let [him] have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.
Luke	And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
Luke	And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.
Luke	He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.
Luke	But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix’ room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.
Luke	Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.
Luke	Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,
Luke	And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.
Luke	But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly [thither].
Luke	Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with [me], and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.
Luke	And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.
Luke	And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.
Luke	While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.
Luke	But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?
Luke	Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.
Luke	For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them.
Luke	I appeal unto Caesar.
Luke	Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar?
Luke	unto Caesar shalt thou go.
Luke	And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.
Luke	And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:
Luke	About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed [me], desiring [to have] judgment against him.
Luke	To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.
Luke	Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.
Luke	Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:
Luke	But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
Luke	And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked [him] whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.
Luke	But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.
Luke	Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself.
Luke	To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.
Luke	And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus’ commandment Paul was brought forth.
Luke	And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and [also] here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.
Luke	But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.
Luke	Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord.
Luke	Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.
Luke	For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes [laid] against him.
Luke	Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself.
Luke	Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:
Luke	I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:
Luke	Especially [because I know] thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.
Luke	My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;
Luke	Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
Luke	And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:
Luke	Unto which [promise] our twelve tribes, instantly serving [God] day and night, hope to come.
Luke	For which hope’s sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.
Luke	Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?
Luke	I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
Luke	Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against [them].
Luke	And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled [them] to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted [them] even unto strange cities.
Luke	Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,
Luke	At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.
Luke	And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
Luke	[it is] hard for thee to kick against the pricks.
Luke	And I said, Who art thou, Lord?
Luke	And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.
Luke	But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;
Luke	Delivering thee from the people, and [from] the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,
Luke	To open their eyes, [and] to turn [them] from darkness to light, and [from] the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.
Luke	Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:
Luke	But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and [then] to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.
Luke	For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill [me].
Luke	Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:
Luke	That Christ should suffer, [and] that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.
Luke	And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.
Luke	But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.
Luke	For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.
Luke	King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets?
Luke	I know that thou believest.
Luke	Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.
Luke	And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.
Luke	And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:
Luke	And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
Luke	Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.
Luke	And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto [one] named Julius, a centurion of Augustus’ band.
Luke	And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; [one] Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
Luke	And the next [day] we touched at Sidon.
Luke	And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave [him] liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.
Luke	And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
Luke	And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, [a city] of Lycia.
Luke	And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.
Luke	And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;
Luke	And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city [of] Lasea.
Luke	Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished [them],
Luke	And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.
Luke	Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.
Luke	And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, [and there] to winter; [which is] an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.
Luke	And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained [their] purpose, loosing [thence], they sailed close by Crete.
Luke	But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.
Luke	And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let [her] drive.
Luke	And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:
Luke	Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.
Luke	And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next [day] they lightened the ship;
Luke	And the third [day] we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.
Luke	And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on [us], all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.
Luke	But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.
Luke	And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of [any man’s] life among you, but of the ship.
Luke	For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,
Luke	Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.
Luke	Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.
Luke	Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.
Luke	But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;
Luke	And sounded, and found [it] twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found [it] fifteen fathoms.
Luke	Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.
Luke	And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,
Luke	Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.
Luke	Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
Luke	And while the day was coming on, Paul besought [them] all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.
Luke	Wherefore I pray you to take [some] meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.
Luke	And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken [it], he began to eat.
Luke	Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took [some] meat.
Luke	And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.
Luke	And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.
Luke	And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.
Luke	And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed [themselves] unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.
Luke	And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.
Luke	And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.
Luke	But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from [their] purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast [themselves] first [into the sea], and get to land:
Luke	And the rest, some on boards, and some on [broken pieces] of the ship.
Luke	And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.
Luke	And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.
Luke	And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
Luke	And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid [them] on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
Luke	And when the barbarians saw the [venomous] beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.
Luke	And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.
Luke	Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
Luke	In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.
Luke	And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.
Luke	So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:
Luke	Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded [us] with such things as were necessary.
Luke	And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.
Luke	And landing at Syracuse, we tarried [there] three days.
Luke	And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:
Luke	Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.
Luke	And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.
Luke	And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.
Luke	And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men [and] brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
Luke	Who, when they had examined me, would have let [me] go, because there was no cause of death in me.
Luke	But when the Jews spake against [it], I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.
Luke	For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see [you], and to speak with [you]: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
Luke	And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.
Luke	But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.
Luke	And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into [his] lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and [out of] the prophets, from morning till evening.
Luke	And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.
Luke	And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,
Luke	Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:
Luke	For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with [their] eyes, and hear with [their] ears, and understand with [their] heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
Luke	Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and [that] they will hear it.
Luke	And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.
Luke	And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,
Luke	Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.
John	Of the tribe of Zabulon [were] sealed twelve thousand.
John	Of the tribe of Joseph [were] sealed twelve thousand.
John	Of the tribe of Benjamin [were] sealed twelve thousand.
John	After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;
John	And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.
John	And all the angels stood round about the throne, and [about] the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,
John	Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, [be] unto our God for ever and ever.
John	Amen.
John	And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes?
John	and whence came they?
John	And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest.
John	And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
John	Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.
John	They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.
John	For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
John	And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.
John	And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.
John	And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer [it] with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.
John	And the smoke of the incense, [which came] with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel’s hand.
John	And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast [it] into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.
John	And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
John	The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
John	And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;
John	And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.
John	And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;
John	And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.
John	And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.
John	And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!
John	And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.
John	And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.
John	And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
John	And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.
John	And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment [was] as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.
John	And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.
John	And the shapes of the locusts [were] like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads [were] as it were crowns like gold, and their faces [were] as the faces of men.
John	And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as [the teeth] of lions.
John	And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings [was] as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.
John	And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power [was] to hurt men five months.
John	And they had a king over them, [which is] the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue [is] Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath [his] name Apollyon.
John	One woe is past; [and], behold, there come two woes more hereafter.
John	And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,
John	Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.
John	And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.
John	And the number of the army of the horsemen [were] two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.
John	And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses [were] as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.
John	By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.
John	For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails [were] like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.
John	And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:
John	Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.
John	And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow [was] upon his head, and his face [was] as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:
John	And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and [his] left [foot] on the earth,
John	And cried with a loud voice, as [when] a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.
John	And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.
John	And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,
John	And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:
John	But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
John	And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go [and] take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.
John	And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book.
John	And he said unto me, Take [it], and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.
John	And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
John	And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.
John	And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.
John	But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty [and] two months.
John	And I will give [power] unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred [and] threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.
John	These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.
John	And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.
John	These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.
John	And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.
John	And their dead bodies [shall lie] in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.
John	And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.
John	And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.
John	And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.
John	And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither.
John	And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.
John	And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
John	The second woe is past; [and], behold, the third woe cometh quickly.
John	And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become [the kingdoms] of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.
John	And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,
John	Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.
John	And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.
John	And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.
John	And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:
John	And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.
John	And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.
John	And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.
John	And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and [to] his throne.
John	And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred [and] threescore days.
John	And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,
John	And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.
John	And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
John	And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.
John	And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.
John	Therefore rejoice, [ye] heavens, and ye that dwell in them.
John	Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea!
John	for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.
John	And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man [child].
John	And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
John	And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.
John	And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
John	And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.
John	And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.
John	And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as [the feet] of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.
John	And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.
John	And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who [is] like unto the beast?
John	who is able to make war with him?
John	And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty [and] two months.
John	And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.
John	And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.
John	And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
John	If any man have an ear, let him hear.
John	He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword.
John	Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
John	And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.
John	And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
John	And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,
John	And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by [the means of] those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.
John	And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.
John	And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
John	And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
John	Here is wisdom.
John	Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number [is] Six hundred threescore [and] six.
John	And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty [and] four thousand, having his Father’s name written in their foreheads.
John	And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:
John	And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred [and] forty [and] four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.
John	These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins.
John	These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.
John	These were redeemed from among men, [being] the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.
John	And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.
John	And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,
John	Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
John	And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
John	And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive [his] mark in his forehead, or in his hand,
John	The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
John	And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.
John	Here is the patience of the saints: here [are] they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
John	And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed [are] the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.
John	And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud [one] sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
John	And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.
John	And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.
John	And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
John	And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.
John	And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast [it] into the great winepress of the wrath of God.
John	And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand [and] six hundred furlongs.
John	And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.
John	And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, [and] over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.
John	And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous [are] thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true [are] thy ways, thou King of saints.
John	Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name?
John	for [thou] only [art] holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.
John	And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:
John	And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.
John	And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.
John	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.
John	And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.
John	And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and [upon] them which worshipped his image.
John	And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead [man]: and every living soul died in the sea.
John	And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.
John	And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.
John	For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.
John	And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous [are] thy judgments.
John	And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.
John	And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.
John	And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,
John	And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.
John	And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.
John	And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs [come] out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
John	For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, [which] go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.
John	Behold, I come as a thief.
John	Blessed [is] he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.
John	And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.
John	And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.
John	And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, [and] so great.
John	And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.
John	And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
John	And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, [every stone] about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.
John	And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:
John	With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.
John	So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
John	And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:
John	And upon her forehead [was] a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
John	And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.
John	And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel?
John	I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.
John	The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.
John	And here [is] the mind which hath wisdom.
John	The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.
John	And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, [and] the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.
John	And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.
John	And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.
John	These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.
John	These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him [are] called, and chosen, and faithful.
John	And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
John	And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.
John	For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.
John	And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.
John	And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.
John	And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.
John	For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.
John	And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.
John	For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.
John	Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.
John	How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.
John	Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong [is] the Lord God who judgeth her.
John	And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,
John	Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city!
John	for in one hour is thy judgment come.
John	And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:
John	The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,
John	And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.
John	And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.
John	The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,
John	And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!
John	For in one hour so great riches is come to nought.
John	And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,
John	And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What [city is] like unto this great city!
John	And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness!
John	for in one hour is she made desolate.
John	Rejoice over her, [thou] heaven, and [ye] holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.
John	And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast [it] into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.
John	And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft [he be], shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;
John	And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.
John	And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.
John	And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:
John	For true and righteous [are] his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.
John	And again they said, Alleluia.
John	And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.
John	And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.
John	And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.
John	And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.
John	Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.
John	And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.
John	And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed [are] they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.
John	And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.
John	And I fell at his feet to worship him.
John	And he said unto me, See [thou do it] not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
John	And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him [was] called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.
John	His eyes [were] as a flame of fire, and on his head [were] many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.
John	And he [was] clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.
John	And the armies [which were] in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
John	And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.
John	And he hath on [his] vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.
John	And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;
John	That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all [men, both] free and bond, both small and great.
John	And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.
John	And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image.
John	These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.
John	And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which [sword] proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.
John	And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
John	And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
John	And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.
John	And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and [I saw] the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received [his] mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
John	But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.
John	This [is] the first resurrection.
John	Blessed and holy [is] he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
John	And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,
John	And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom [is] as the sand of the sea.
John	And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
John	And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [are], and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
John	And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
John	And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is [the book] of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
John	And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
John	And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire.
John	This is the second death.
John	And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
John	And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.
John	And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
John	And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God [is] with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, [and be] their God.
John	And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.
John	And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.
John	And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.
John	And he said unto me, It is done.
John	I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.
John	I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.
John	He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
John	But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.
John	And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife.
John	And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,
John	Having the glory of God: and her light [was] like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;
John	And had a wall great and high, [and] had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are [the names] of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:
John	On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
John	And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
John	And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.
John	And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs.
John	The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
John	And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred [and] forty [and] four cubits, [according to] the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.
John	And the building of the wall of it was [of] jasper: and the city [was] pure gold, like unto clear glass.
John	And the foundations of the wall of the city [were] garnished with all manner of precious stones.
John	The first foundation [was] jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;
John	The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.
John	And the twelve gates [were] twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city [was] pure gold, as it were transparent glass.
John	And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.
John	And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb [is] the light thereof.
John	And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.
John	And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.
John	And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.
John	And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither [whatsoever] worketh abomination, or [maketh] a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.
John	And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.
John	In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, [was there] the tree of life, which bare twelve [manner of] fruits, [and] yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree [were] for the healing of the nations.
John	And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:
John	And they shall see his face; and his name [shall be] in their foreheads.
John	And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.
John	And he said unto me, These sayings [are] faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.
John	Behold, I come quickly: blessed [is] he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.
John	And I John saw these things, and heard [them].
John	And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things.
John	Then saith he unto me, See [thou do it] not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.
John	And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.
John	He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.
John	And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward [is] with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.
John	I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.
John	Blessed [are] they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.
John	For without [are] dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.
John	I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches.
John	I am the root and the offspring of David, [and] the bright and morning star.
John	And the Spirit and the bride say, Come.
John	And let him that heareth say, Come.
John	And let him that is athirst come.
John	And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.
John	For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:
John	And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and [from] the things which are written in this book.
John	He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly.
John	Amen.
John	Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
John	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all.
John	Amen.
Paul	Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
Paul	But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, [is] therefore Christ the minister of sin?
Paul	God forbid.
Paul	For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.
Paul	For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.
Paul	I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
Paul	I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness [come] by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.
Paul	O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?
Paul	This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
Paul	Are ye so foolish?
Paul	having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?
Paul	Have ye suffered so many things in vain?
Paul	if [it be] yet in vain.
Paul	He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, [doeth he it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
Paul	Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.
Paul	Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.
Paul	And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, [saying], In thee shall all nations be blessed.
Paul	So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
Paul	For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.
Paul	But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, [it is] evident: for, The just shall live by faith.
Paul	And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.
Paul	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that hangeth on a tree:
Paul	That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
Paul	Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though [it be] but a man’s covenant, yet [if it be] confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.
Paul	Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made.
Paul	He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.
Paul	And this I say, [that] the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.
Paul	For if the inheritance [be] of the law, [it is] no more of promise: but God gave [it] to Abraham by promise.
Paul	Wherefore then [serveth] the law?
Paul	It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; [and it was] ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.
Paul	Now a mediator is not [a mediator] of one, but God is one.
Paul	[Is] the law then against the promises of God?
Paul	God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.
Paul	But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.
Paul	But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
Paul	Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
Paul	But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.
Paul	For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
Paul	For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
Paul	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.
Paul	And if ye [be] Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.
Paul	Now I say, [That] the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;
Paul	But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.
Paul	Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:
Paul	But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,
Paul	To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
Paul	And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
Paul	Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
Paul	Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.
Paul	But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?
Paul	Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.
Paul	I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.
Paul	Brethren, I beseech you, be as I [am]; for I [am] as ye [are]: ye have not injured me at all.
Paul	Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.
Paul	And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, [even] as Christ Jesus.
Paul	Where is then the blessedness ye spake of?
Paul	for I bear you record, that, if [it had been] possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.
Paul	Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?
Paul	They zealously affect you, [but] not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.
Paul	But [it is] good to be zealously affected always in [a] good [thing], and not only when I am present with you.
Paul	My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,
Paul	I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.
Paul	Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?
Paul	For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.
Paul	But he [who was] of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman [was] by promise.
Paul	Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.
Paul	For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.
Paul	But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.
Paul	For it is written, Rejoice, [thou] barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.
Paul	Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
Paul	But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him [that was born] after the Spirit, even so [it is] now.
Paul	Nevertheless what saith the scripture?
Paul	Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.
Paul	So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.
Paul	Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.
Paul	Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
Paul	For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
Paul	Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.
Paul	For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
Paul	For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.
Paul	Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
Paul	This persuasion [cometh] not of him that calleth you.
Paul	A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
Paul	I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.
Paul	And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution?
Paul	then is the offence of the cross ceased.
Paul	I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
Paul	For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only [use] not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.
Paul	For all the law is fulfilled in one word, [even] in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
Paul	But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
Paul	[This] I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
Paul	For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
Paul	But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
Paul	Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are [these]; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
Paul	Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
Paul	Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told [you] in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
Paul	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
Paul	Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.
Paul	And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
Paul	If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
Paul	Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
Paul	Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
Paul	Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
Paul	For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.
Paul	But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.
Paul	For every man shall bear his own burden.
Paul	Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.
Paul	Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
Paul	For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
Paul	And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
Paul	As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all [men], especially unto them who are of the household of faith.
Paul	Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.
Paul	As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
Paul	For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
Paul	But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
Paul	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
Paul	And as many as walk according to this rule, peace [be] on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
Paul	From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
Paul	Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit.
Paul	Amen.
Paul	Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:
Paul	Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.
Paul	I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,
Paul	Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,
Paul	For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;
Paul	Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform [it] until the day of Jesus Christ:
Paul	Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.
Paul	For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
Paul	And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and [in] all judgment;
Paul	That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;
Paul	Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
Paul	But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things [which happened] unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;
Paul	So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other [places];
Paul	And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
Paul	Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:
Paul	The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:
Paul	But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.
Paul	What then?
Paul	notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
Paul	For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
Paul	According to my earnest expectation and [my] hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether [it be] by life, or by death.
Paul	For to me to live [is] Christ, and to die [is] gain.
Paul	But if I live in the flesh, this [is] the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.
Paul	For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:
Paul	Nevertheless to abide in the flesh [is] more needful for you.
Paul	And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;
Paul	That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.
Paul	Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;
Paul	And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.
Paul	For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;
Paul	Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear [to be] in me.
Paul	If [there be] therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,
Paul	Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, [being] of one accord, of one mind.
Paul	[Let] nothing [be done] through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
Paul	Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.
Paul	Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
Paul	Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:
Paul	But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:
Paul	And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
Paul	Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
Paul	That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of [things] in heaven, and [things] in earth, and [things] under the earth;
Paul	And [that] every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
Paul	Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
Paul	For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of [his] good pleasure.
Paul	Do all things without murmurings and disputings:
Paul	That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;
Paul	Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.
Paul	Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.
Paul	For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.
Paul	But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.
Paul	For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.
Paul	For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s.
Paul	But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.
Paul	Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.
Paul	But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
Paul	Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.
Paul	For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.
Paul	For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
Paul	I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
Paul	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:
Paul	Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.
Paul	Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord.
Paul	To write the same things to you, to me indeed [is] not grievous, but for you [it is] safe.
Paul	Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.
Paul	For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.
Paul	Though I might also have confidence in the flesh.
Paul	If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:
Paul	Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, [of] the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;
Paul	Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.
Paul	But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.
Paul	Yea doubtless, and I count all things [but] loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them [but] dung, that I may win Christ,
Paul	And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:
Paul	That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;
Paul	If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.
Paul	Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
Paul	Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but [this] one thing [I do], forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,
Paul	I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
Paul	Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.
Paul	Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.
Paul	Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.
Paul	(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, [that they are] the enemies of the cross of Christ:
Paul	Whose end [is] destruction, whose God [is their] belly, and [whose] glory [is] in their shame, who mind earthly things.)
Paul	For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:
Paul	Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
Paul	Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, [my] dearly beloved.
Paul	I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.
Paul	And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and [with] other my fellowlabourers, whose names [are] in the book of life.
Paul	Rejoice in the Lord alway: [and] again I say, Rejoice.
Paul	Let your moderation be known unto all men.
Paul	The Lord [is] at hand.
Paul	Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.
Paul	And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
Paul	Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things [are] honest, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] lovely, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue, and if [there be] any praise, think on these things.
Paul	Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.
Paul	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.
Paul	Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, [therewith] to be content.
Paul	I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
Paul	I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
Paul	Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.
Paul	Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.
Paul	For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.
Paul	Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
Paul	But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things [which were sent] from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.
Paul	But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
Paul	Now unto God and our Father [be] glory for ever and ever.
Paul	Amen.
Paul	Salute every saint in Christ Jesus.
Paul	The brethren which are with me greet you.
Paul	All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar’s household.
Paul	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all.
Paul	Amen.
Paul	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians [which is] in God the Father and [in] the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Paul	We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;
Paul	Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;
Paul	Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.
Paul	For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.
Paul	And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:
Paul	So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
Paul	For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.
Paul	For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;
Paul	And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, [even] Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.
Paul	For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:
Paul	But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.
Paul	For our exhortation [was] not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:
Paul	But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.
Paul	For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God [is] witness:
Paul	Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor [yet] of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.
Paul	But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:
Paul	So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.
Paul	For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.
Paul	Ye [are] witnesses, and God [also], how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:
Paul	As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father [doth] his children,
Paul	That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.
Paul	For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received [it] not [as] the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.
Paul	For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they [have] of the Jews:
Paul	Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:
Paul	Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.
Paul	But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.
Paul	Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.
Paul	For what [is] our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing?
Paul	[Are] not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?
Paul	For ye are our glory and joy.
Paul	Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;
Paul	And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:
Paul	That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.
Paul	For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.
Paul	For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.
Paul	But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also [to see] you:
Paul	Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:
Paul	For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.
Paul	For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;
Paul	Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
Paul	Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.
Paul	And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all [men], even as we [do] toward you:
Paul	To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.
Paul	Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort [you] by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, [so] ye would abound more and more.
Paul	For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
Paul	For this is the will of God, [even] your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:
Paul	That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;
Paul	Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:
Paul	That no [man] go beyond and defraud his brother in [any] matter: because that the Lord [is] the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.
Paul	For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.
Paul	He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.
Paul	But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.
Paul	And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;
Paul	And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;
Paul	That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and [that] ye may have lack of nothing.
Paul	But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.
Paul	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
Paul	For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive [and] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.
Paul	For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
Paul	Then we which are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
Paul	Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
Paul	But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.
Paul	For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
Paul	For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
Paul	But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
Paul	Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
Paul	Therefore let us not sleep, as [do] others; but let us watch and be sober.
Paul	For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.
Paul	But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.
Paul	For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
Paul	Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
Paul	Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.
Paul	And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;
Paul	And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake.
Paul	[And] be at peace among yourselves.
Paul	Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all [men].
Paul	See that none render evil for evil unto any [man]; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all [men].
Paul	Rejoice evermore.
Paul	Pray without ceasing.
Paul	In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
Paul	Quench not the Spirit.
Paul	Despise not prophesyings.
Paul	Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
Paul	Abstain from all appearance of evil.
Paul	And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and [I pray God] your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Paul	Faithful [is] he that calleth you, who also will do [it].
Paul	Brethren, pray for us.
Paul	Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.
Paul	I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.
Paul	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you.
Paul	Amen.
Paul	Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy [our] brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,
Paul	And to [our] beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:
Paul	Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Paul	I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,
Paul	Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;
Paul	That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
Paul	For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.
Paul	Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,
Paul	Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech [thee], being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
Paul	I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:
Paul	Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:
Paul	Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:
Paul	Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
Paul	But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
Paul	For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;
Paul	Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?
Paul	If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.
Paul	If he hath wronged thee, or oweth [thee] ought, put that on mine account;
Paul	I Paul have written [it] with mine own hand, I will repay [it]: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.
Paul	Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.
Paul	Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.
Paul	But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
Paul	There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;
Paul	Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.
Paul	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit.
Paul	Amen.
Peter	If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy [are ye]; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.
Peter	But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or [as] a thief, or [as] an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters.
Peter	Yet if [any man suffer] as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.
Peter	For the time [is come] that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if [it] first [begin] at us, what shall the end [be] of them that obey not the gospel of God?
Peter	And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?
Peter	Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls [to him] in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.
Peter	The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:
Peter	Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight [thereof], not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;
Peter	Neither as being lords over [God’s] heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.
Peter	And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.
Peter	Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder.
Peter	Yea, all [of you] be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.
Peter	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:
Peter	Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.
Peter	Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:
Peter	Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.
Peter	But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle [you].
Peter	To him [be] glory and dominion for ever and ever.
Peter	Amen.
Peter	By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.
Peter	The [church that is] at Babylon, elected together with [you], saluteth you; and [so doth] Marcus my son.
Peter	Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity.
Peter	Peace [be] with you all that are in Christ Jesus.
Peter	Amen.
James	Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.
James	Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire.
James	Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.
James	Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.
James	Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.
James	Ye have condemned [and] killed the just; [and] he doth not resist you.
James	Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.
James	Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.
James	Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.
James	Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.
James	Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.
James	Behold, we count them happy which endure.
James	Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.
James	But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and [your] nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.
James	Is any among you afflicted?
James	let him pray.
James	Is any merry?
James	let him sing psalms.
James	Is any sick among you?
James	let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
James	And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.
James	Confess [your] faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed.
James	The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.
James	Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.
James	And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.
James	Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;
James	Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.
Jude	Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
Jude	And of some have compassion, making a difference:
Jude	And others save with fear, pulling [them] out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.
Jude	Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present [you] faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,
Jude	To the only wise God our Saviour, [be] glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever.
Jude	Amen.
