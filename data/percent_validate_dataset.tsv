Matthew	Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?
Matthew	Blessed [is] that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.
Matthew	Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.
Matthew	But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;
Matthew	And shall begin to smite [his] fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;
Matthew	The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for [him], and in an hour that he is not aware of,
Matthew	And shall cut him asunder, and appoint [him] his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew	Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
Matthew	And five of them were wise, and five [were] foolish.
Matthew	They that [were] foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
Matthew	But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
Matthew	While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
Matthew	And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
Matthew	Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
Matthew	And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
Matthew	But the wise answered, saying, [Not so]; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
Matthew	And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.
Matthew	Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
Matthew	But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
Matthew	Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.
Matthew	For [the kingdom of heaven is] as a man travelling into a far country, [who] called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
Matthew	And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.
Matthew	Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made [them] other five talents.
Matthew	And likewise he that [had received] two, he also gained other two.
Matthew	But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.
Matthew	After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.
Matthew	And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.
Matthew	His lord said unto him, Well done, [thou] good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
Matthew	He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.
Matthew	His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
Matthew	Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:
Matthew	And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, [there] thou hast [that is] thine.
Matthew	His lord answered and said unto him, [Thou] wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:
Matthew	Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and [then] at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.
Matthew	Take therefore the talent from him, and give [it] unto him which hath ten talents.
Matthew	For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.
Matthew	And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew	When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:
Matthew	And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth [his] sheep from the goats:
Matthew	And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
Matthew	Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
Matthew	For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:
Matthew	Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
Matthew	Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed [thee]?
Matthew	or thirsty, and gave [thee] drink?
Matthew	When saw we thee a stranger, and took [thee] in?
Matthew	or naked, and clothed [thee]?
Matthew	Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
Matthew	And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done [it] unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done [it] unto me.
Matthew	Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
Matthew	For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:
Matthew	I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
Matthew	Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
Matthew	Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did [it] not to one of the least of these, ye did [it] not to me.
Matthew	And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

Matthew	Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
Matthew	There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat [at meat].
Matthew	But when his disciples saw [it], they had indignation, saying, To what purpose [is] this waste?
Matthew	For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
Matthew	When Jesus understood [it], he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman?
Matthew	for she hath wrought a good work upon me.
Matthew	For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.
Matthew	For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did [it] for my burial.
Matthew	Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, [there] shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.
Matthew	Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,

Matthew	Now the first [day] of the [feast of] unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
Matthew	And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.
Matthew	And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.

Matthew	And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave [it] to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;

Matthew	And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
Matthew	Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.
Matthew	And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou [wilt].
Matthew	And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?
Matthew	Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed [is] willing, but the flesh [is] weak.
Matthew	He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.
Matthew	And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.
Matthew	And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.
Matthew	Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take [your] rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Matthew	Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.
Matthew	And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
Matthew	Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.
Matthew	And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.
Matthew	And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come?
Matthew	Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.
Matthew	And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out [his] hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s, and smote off his ear.
Matthew	Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.
Matthew	Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?
Matthew	But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
Matthew	In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me?
Matthew	I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.
Matthew	But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.
Matthew	Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
Matthew	And they that had laid hold on Jesus led [him] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.

Mark	And they murmured against her.
Mark	And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her?
Mark	she hath wrought a good work on me.
Mark	For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.
Mark	She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.
Mark	Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, [this] also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.

Mark	And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?
Mark	And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.
Mark	And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
Mark	And he will shew you a large upper room furnished [and] prepared: there make ready for us.
Mark	And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
Mark	And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.
Mark	And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.
Mark	And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, [Is] it I?
Mark	and another [said, Is] it I?
Mark	And he answered and said unto them, [It is] one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.
Mark	The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed!
Mark	good were it for that man if he had never been born.
Mark	And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake [it], and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.
Mark	And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave [it] to them: and they all drank of it.
Mark	And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.
Mark	Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.

Mark	But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet [will] not I.
Mark	And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, [even] in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.
Mark	But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise.
Mark	Likewise also said they all.
Mark	And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.
Mark	And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;
Mark	And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.
Mark	And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
Mark	And he said, Abba, Father, all things [are] possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.
Mark	And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou?
Mark	couldest not thou watch one hour?
Mark	Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.
Mark	The spirit truly [is] ready, but the flesh [is] weak.
Mark	And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.
Mark	And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.
Mark	And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take [your] rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Mark	Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.
Mark	And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
Mark	And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead [him] away safely.
Mark	And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.
Mark	And they laid their hands on him, and took him.
Mark	And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
Mark	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and [with] staves to take me?
Mark	I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.
Mark	And they all forsook him, and fled.
Mark	And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about [his] naked [body]; and the young men laid hold on him:
Mark	And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
Mark	And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.
Mark	And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.
Mark	And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.
Mark	For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.
Mark	And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,
Mark	We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.
Mark	But neither so did their witness agree together.
Mark	And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing?
Mark	what [is it which] these witness against thee?
Mark	But he held his peace, and answered nothing.
Mark	Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?
Mark	And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
Mark	Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?
Mark	Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye?
Mark	And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.
Mark	And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.
Mark	And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:
Mark	And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.
Mark	But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest.
Mark	And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.
Mark	And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is [one] of them.
Mark	And he denied it again.
Luke	And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.
Luke	And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.
Luke	Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,
Luke	After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.
Luke	And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.
Luke	And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.
Luke	And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.
Luke	Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next [day] to Neapolis;
Luke	And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, [and] a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.
Luke	And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted [thither].
Luke	And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard [us]: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.
Luke	And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought [us], saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide [there].
Luke	And she constrained us.
Luke	And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:
Luke	The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.
Luke	And this did she many days.
Luke	But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.
Luke	And he came out the same hour.
Luke	And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew [them] into the marketplace unto the rulers,
Luke	And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,
Luke	And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.
Luke	And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat [them].
Luke	And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast [them] into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:
Luke	Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
Luke	And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.
Luke	And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed.
Luke	And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.
Luke	But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.
Luke	Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,
Luke	And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
Luke	And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.
Luke	And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.
Luke	And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed [their] stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.
Luke	And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.
Luke	And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.
Luke	And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.
Luke	But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast [us] into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily?
Luke	nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.
Luke	And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.
Luke	And they came and besought them, and brought [them] out, and desired [them] to depart out of the city.
Luke	And they went out of the prison, and entered into [the house of] Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.
Luke	Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:
Luke	And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,
Luke	Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.
Luke	And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.
Luke	But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.
Luke	And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;
Luke	Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, [one] Jesus.
Luke	And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.
Luke	And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.
Luke	And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming [thither] went into the synagogue of the Jews.
Luke	These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.
Luke	Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.
Luke	But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.
Luke	And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.
Luke	And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.
Luke	Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.
Luke	Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.
Luke	Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him.
Luke	And some said, What will this babbler say?
Luke	other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.
Luke	And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, [is]?
Luke	For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.
Luke	(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)
Luke	Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, and said, [Ye] men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.
Luke	For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.
Luke	Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.
Luke	God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
Luke	Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
Luke	And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
Luke	That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:
Luke	For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.
Luke	Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man’s device.
Luke	And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:
Luke	Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by [that] man whom he hath ordained; [whereof] he hath given assurance unto all [men], in that he hath raised him from the dead.
Luke	And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this [matter].
Luke	So Paul departed from among them.
Luke	Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which [was] Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
Luke	After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;
Luke	And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.
Luke	And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.
Luke	And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.
Luke	And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews [that] Jesus [was] Christ.
Luke	And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook [his] raiment, and said unto them, Your blood [be] upon your own heads; I [am] clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.
Luke	And he departed thence, and entered into a certain [man’s] house, named Justus, [one] that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.
Luke	And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.
Luke	Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:
Luke	For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.
Luke	And he continued [there] a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
Luke	And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,
Luke	Saying, This [fellow] persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.
Luke	And when Paul was now about to open [his] mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O [ye] Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:
Luke	But if it be a question of words and names, and [of] your law, look ye [to it]; for I will be no judge of such [matters].
Luke	And he drave them from the judgment seat.
Luke	Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat [him] before the judgment seat.
Luke	And Gallio cared for none of those things.
Luke	And Paul [after this] tarried [there] yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn [his] head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.
Luke	And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.
Luke	When they desired [him] to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;
Luke	But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will.
Luke	And he sailed from Ephesus.
Luke	And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.
Luke	And after he had spent some time [there], he departed, and went over [all] the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.
Luke	And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, [and] mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.
Luke	This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.
Luke	And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto [them], and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.
Luke	And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:
Luke	For he mightily convinced the Jews, [and that] publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.
Luke	And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,
Luke	He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?
Luke	And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.
Luke	And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized?
Luke	And they said, Unto John’s baptism.
Luke	Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.
Luke	When they heard [this], they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
Luke	And when Paul had laid [his] hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.
Luke	And all the men were about twelve.
Luke	And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.
Luke	But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.
Luke	And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
Luke	And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:
Luke	So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.
Luke	Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.
Luke	And there were seven sons of [one] Sceva, a Jew, [and] chief of the priests, which did so.
Luke	And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?
Luke	And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
Luke	And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
Luke	And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.
Luke	Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all [men]: and they counted the price of them, and found [it] fifty thousand [pieces] of silver.
Luke	So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.
Luke	After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.
Luke	So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.
Luke	And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.
Luke	For a certain [man] named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;
Luke	Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.
Luke	Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:
Luke	So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.
Luke	And when they heard [these sayings], they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great [is] Diana of the Ephesians.
Luke	And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.
Luke	And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.
Luke	And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring [him] that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.
Luke	Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.
Luke	And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward.
Luke	And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.
Luke	But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great [is] Diana of the Ephesians.
Luke	And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, [Ye] men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the [image] which fell down from Jupiter?
Luke	Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.
Luke	For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.
Luke	Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.
Luke	But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.
Luke	For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.
Luke	And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
Luke	And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto [him] the disciples, and embraced [them], and departed for to go into Macedonia.
Luke	And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,
Luke	And [there] abode three months.
Luke	And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.
Luke	And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.
Luke	These going before tarried for us at Troas.
Luke	And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.
Luke	And upon the first [day] of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.
Luke	And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.
Luke	And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.
Luke	And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing [him] said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.
Luke	When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.
Luke	And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.
Luke	And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.
Luke	And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.
Luke	And we sailed thence, and came the next [day] over against Chios; and the next [day] we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next [day] we came to Miletus.
Luke	For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.
Luke	And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.
Luke	And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,
Luke	Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:
Luke	[And] how I kept back nothing that was profitable [unto you], but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,
Luke	Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
Luke	And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:
Luke	Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.
Luke	But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
Luke	And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.
Luke	Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I [am] pure from the blood of all [men].
Luke	For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.
Luke	Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.
Luke	For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
Luke	Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.
Luke	Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.
Luke	And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.
Luke	I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.
Luke	Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.
Luke	I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.
Luke	And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.
Luke	And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him,
Luke	Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more.
Luke	And they accompanied him unto the ship.
Luke	And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the [day] following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:
Luke	And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.
Luke	Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.
Luke	And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.
Luke	And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till [we were] out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.
Luke	And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.
Luke	And when we had finished [our] course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.
Luke	And the next [day] we that were of Paul’s company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was [one] of the seven; and abode with him.
Luke	And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.
Luke	And as we tarried [there] many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.
Luke	And when he was come unto us, he took Paul’s girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver [him] into the hands of the Gentiles.
Luke	And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.
Luke	Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?
Luke	for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
Luke	And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.
Luke	And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.
Luke	There went with us also [certain] of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.
Luke	And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
Luke	And the [day] following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.
Luke	And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.
Luke	And when they heard [it], they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:
Luke	And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise [their] children, neither to walk after the customs.
Luke	What is it therefore?
Luke	the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.
Luke	Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;
Luke	Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave [their] heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but [that] thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.
Luke	As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written [and] concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from [things] offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.
Luke	Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.
Luke	And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,
Luke	Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all [men] every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.
Luke	(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)
Luke	And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.
Luke	And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
Luke	Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul.
Luke	Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded [him] to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.
Luke	And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.
Luke	And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.
Luke	For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.
Luke	And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee?
Luke	Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?
Luke	Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?
Luke	But Paul said, I am a man [which am] a Jew of Tarsus, [a city] in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.
Luke	And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people.
Luke	And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto [them] in the Hebrew tongue, saying,
Luke	Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence [which I make] now unto you.
Luke	(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)
Luke	I am verily a man [which am] a Jew, born in Tarsus, [a city] in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, [and] taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.
Luke	And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
Luke	As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.
John	Of the tribe of Gad [were] sealed twelve thousand.
John	Of the tribe of Aser [were] sealed twelve thousand.
John	Of the tribe of Nepthalim [were] sealed twelve thousand.
John	Of the tribe of Manasses [were] sealed twelve thousand.
John	Of the tribe of Simeon [were] sealed twelve thousand.
John	Of the tribe of Levi [were] sealed twelve thousand.
John	Of the tribe of Issachar [were] sealed twelve thousand.
John	Of the tribe of Zabulon [were] sealed twelve thousand.
John	Of the tribe of Joseph [were] sealed twelve thousand.
John	Of the tribe of Benjamin [were] sealed twelve thousand.
John	After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;
John	And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.
John	And all the angels stood round about the throne, and [about] the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,
John	Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, [be] unto our God for ever and ever.
John	Amen.
John	And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes?
John	and whence came they?
John	And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest.
John	And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
John	Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.
John	They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.
John	For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
John	And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.
John	And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.
John	And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer [it] with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.
John	And the smoke of the incense, [which came] with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel’s hand.
John	And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast [it] into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.
John	And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
John	The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
John	And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;
John	And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.
John	And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;
John	And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.
John	And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.
John	And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!
John	And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.
John	And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.
John	And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
John	And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.
John	And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment [was] as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.
John	And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.
John	And the shapes of the locusts [were] like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads [were] as it were crowns like gold, and their faces [were] as the faces of men.
John	And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as [the teeth] of lions.
John	And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings [was] as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.
John	And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power [was] to hurt men five months.
John	And they had a king over them, [which is] the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue [is] Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath [his] name Apollyon.
John	One woe is past; [and], behold, there come two woes more hereafter.
John	And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,
John	Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.
John	And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.
John	And the number of the army of the horsemen [were] two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.
John	And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses [were] as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.
John	By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.
John	For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails [were] like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.
John	And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:
John	Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.
John	And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow [was] upon his head, and his face [was] as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:
John	And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and [his] left [foot] on the earth,
John	And cried with a loud voice, as [when] a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.
John	And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.
John	And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,
John	And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:
John	But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
John	And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go [and] take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.
John	And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book.
John	And he said unto me, Take [it], and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.
John	And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
John	And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.
John	And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.
John	But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty [and] two months.
John	And I will give [power] unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred [and] threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.
John	These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.
John	And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.
John	These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.
John	And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.
John	And their dead bodies [shall lie] in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.
John	And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.
John	And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.
John	And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.
John	And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither.
John	And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.
John	And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
John	The second woe is past; [and], behold, the third woe cometh quickly.
John	And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become [the kingdoms] of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.
John	And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,
John	Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.
John	And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.
John	And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.
John	And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:
John	And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.
John	And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.
John	And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.
John	And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and [to] his throne.
John	And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred [and] threescore days.
John	And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,
John	And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.
John	And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
John	And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.
John	And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.
John	Therefore rejoice, [ye] heavens, and ye that dwell in them.
John	Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea!
John	for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.
John	And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man [child].
John	And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
John	And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.
John	And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
John	And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.
John	And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.
John	And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as [the feet] of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.
John	And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.
John	And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who [is] like unto the beast?
John	who is able to make war with him?
John	And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty [and] two months.
John	And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.
John	And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.
John	And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
John	If any man have an ear, let him hear.
John	He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword.
John	Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
John	And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.
John	And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
John	And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,
John	And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by [the means of] those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.
John	And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.
John	And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
John	And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
John	Here is wisdom.
John	Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number [is] Six hundred threescore [and] six.
John	And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty [and] four thousand, having his Father’s name written in their foreheads.
John	And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:
John	And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred [and] forty [and] four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.
John	These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins.
John	These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.
John	These were redeemed from among men, [being] the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.
John	And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.
John	And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,
John	Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
John	And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
John	And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive [his] mark in his forehead, or in his hand,
John	The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
John	And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.
John	Here is the patience of the saints: here [are] they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
John	And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed [are] the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.
John	And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud [one] sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
John	And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.
John	And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.
John	And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
John	And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.
John	And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast [it] into the great winepress of the wrath of God.
John	And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand [and] six hundred furlongs.
John	And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.
John	And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, [and] over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.
John	And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous [are] thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true [are] thy ways, thou King of saints.
John	Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name?
John	for [thou] only [art] holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.
John	And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:
John	And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.
John	And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.
John	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.
John	And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.
John	And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and [upon] them which worshipped his image.
John	And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead [man]: and every living soul died in the sea.
John	And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.
John	And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.
John	For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.
Paul	For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God.
Paul	For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.
Paul	Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves.
Paul	Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?
Paul	But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.
Paul	Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.
Paul	For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
Paul	For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, [even] your perfection.
Paul	Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.
Paul	Finally, brethren, farewell.
Paul	Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
Paul	Greet one another with an holy kiss.
Paul	All the saints salute you.
Paul	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, [be] with you all.
Paul	Amen.
Paul	Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)
Paul	And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:
Paul	Grace [be] to you and peace from God the Father, and [from] our Lord Jesus Christ,
Paul	Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:
Paul	To whom [be] glory for ever and ever.
Paul	Amen.
Paul	I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:
Paul	Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.
Paul	But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
Paul	As we said before, so say I now again, If any [man] preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.
Paul	For do I now persuade men, or God?
Paul	or do I seek to please men?
Paul	for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
Paul	But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.
Paul	For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught [it], but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
Paul	For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:
Paul	And profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.
Paul	But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called [me] by his grace,
Paul	To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:
Paul	Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.
Paul	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.
Paul	But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.
Paul	Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.
Paul	Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;
Paul	And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:
Paul	But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.
Paul	And they glorified God in me.
Paul	Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with [me] also.
Paul	And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.
Paul	But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:
Paul	And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:
Paul	To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
Paul	But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man’s person:) for they who seemed [to be somewhat] in conference added nothing to me:
Paul	But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as [the gospel] of the circumcision [was] unto Peter;
Paul	(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)
Paul	And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we [should go] unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.
Paul	Only [they would] that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.
Paul	But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.
Paul	For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.
Paul	And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.
Paul	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before [them] all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?
Paul	We [who are] Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,
Paul	Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
Paul	But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, [is] therefore Christ the minister of sin?
Paul	God forbid.
Paul	For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.
Paul	For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.
Paul	I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
Paul	I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness [come] by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.
Paul	O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?
Paul	This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
Paul	Are ye so foolish?
Paul	having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?
Paul	Have ye suffered so many things in vain?
Paul	if [it be] yet in vain.
Paul	He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, [doeth he it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
Paul	Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.
Paul	Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.
Paul	And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, [saying], In thee shall all nations be blessed.
Paul	So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
Paul	For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.
Paul	But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, [it is] evident: for, The just shall live by faith.
Paul	And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.
Paul	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that hangeth on a tree:
Paul	That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
Paul	Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though [it be] but a man’s covenant, yet [if it be] confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.
Paul	Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made.
Paul	He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.
Paul	And this I say, [that] the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.
Paul	For if the inheritance [be] of the law, [it is] no more of promise: but God gave [it] to Abraham by promise.
Paul	Wherefore then [serveth] the law?
Paul	It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; [and it was] ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.
Paul	Now a mediator is not [a mediator] of one, but God is one.
Paul	[Is] the law then against the promises of God?
Paul	God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.
Paul	But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.
Paul	But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
Paul	Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
Paul	But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.
Paul	For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
Paul	For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
Paul	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.
Paul	And if ye [be] Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.
Paul	Now I say, [That] the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;
Paul	But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.
Paul	Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:
Paul	But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,
Paul	To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
Paul	And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
Paul	Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
Paul	Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.
Paul	But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?
Paul	Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.
Paul	I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.
Paul	Brethren, I beseech you, be as I [am]; for I [am] as ye [are]: ye have not injured me at all.
Paul	Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.
Paul	And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, [even] as Christ Jesus.
Paul	Where is then the blessedness ye spake of?
Paul	for I bear you record, that, if [it had been] possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.
Paul	Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?
Paul	They zealously affect you, [but] not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.
Paul	But [it is] good to be zealously affected always in [a] good [thing], and not only when I am present with you.
Paul	My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,
Paul	I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.
Paul	Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?
Paul	For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.
Paul	But he [who was] of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman [was] by promise.
Paul	Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.
Paul	For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.
Paul	But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.
Paul	For it is written, Rejoice, [thou] barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.
Paul	Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
Paul	But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him [that was born] after the Spirit, even so [it is] now.
Paul	Nevertheless what saith the scripture?
Paul	Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.
Paul	So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.
Paul	Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.
Paul	Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
Paul	For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
Paul	Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.
Paul	For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
Paul	For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.
Paul	Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
Paul	This persuasion [cometh] not of him that calleth you.
Paul	A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
Paul	I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.
Paul	And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution?
Paul	then is the offence of the cross ceased.
Paul	I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
Paul	For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only [use] not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.
Paul	For all the law is fulfilled in one word, [even] in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
Paul	But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
Paul	[This] I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
Paul	For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
Paul	But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
Paul	Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are [these]; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
Paul	Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
Paul	Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told [you] in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
Paul	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
Paul	Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.
Paul	And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
Paul	If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
Paul	Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
Paul	Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
Paul	Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
Paul	For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.
Paul	But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.
Paul	For every man shall bear his own burden.
Paul	Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.
Paul	Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
Paul	For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
Paul	And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
Peter	The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:
Peter	But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government.
Peter	Presumptuous [are they], selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.
Peter	Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.
Peter	But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;
Peter	And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, [as] they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time.
Peter	Spots [they are] and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;
Peter	Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:
Peter	Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam [the son] of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;
Peter	But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man’s voice forbad the madness of the prophet.
Peter	These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.
Peter	For when they speak great swelling [words] of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, [through much] wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.
Peter	While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.
Peter	For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.
Peter	For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known [it], to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.
Peter	But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog [is] turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.
Peter	This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in [both] which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:
Peter	That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:
James	Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.
James	Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire.
James	Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.
James	Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.
James	Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.
James	Ye have condemned [and] killed the just; [and] he doth not resist you.
James	Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.
James	Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.
James	Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.
James	Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.
James	Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.
James	Behold, we count them happy which endure.
James	Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.
Jude	Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
Jude	And of some have compassion, making a difference:
Jude	And others save with fear, pulling [them] out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.
