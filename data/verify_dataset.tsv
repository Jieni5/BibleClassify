John	The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;	0
John	For the truth’s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.	1
John	Grace be with you, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.	2
John	I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.	3
John	And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.	4
John	And this is love, that we walk after his commandments.	5
John	This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.	6
John	For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.	7
John	This is a deceiver and an antichrist.	8
John	Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.	9
John	Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God.	10
John	He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.	11
John	If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into [your] house, neither bid him God speed:	12
John	For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.	13
John	Having many things to write unto you, I would not [write] with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.	14
John	The children of thy elect sister greet thee.	15
John	Amen.	16
John	The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.	17
John	Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.	18
John	For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.	19
John	I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.	20
John	Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;	21
John	Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:	22
John	Because that for his name’s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.	23
John	We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.	24
John	I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.	25
John	Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth [them] out of the church.	26
John	Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good.	27
John	He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.	28
John	Demetrius hath good report of all [men], and of the truth itself: yea, and we [also] bear record; and ye know that our record is true.	29
John	I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:	30
John	But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face.	31
John	Peace [be] to thee.	32
John	[Our] friends salute thee.	33
John	Greet the friends by name.	34
Paul	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:	35
Paul	Grace [be] to you, and peace, from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.	36
Paul	Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly [places] in Christ:	37
Paul	According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:	38
Paul	Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,	39
Paul	To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.	40
Paul	In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;	41
Paul	Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;	42
Paul	Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:	43
Paul	That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; [even] in him:	44
Paul	In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:	45
Paul	That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.	46
Paul	In whom ye also [trusted], after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,	47
Paul	Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.	48
Paul	Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,	49
Paul	Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;	50
Paul	That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:	51
Paul	The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,	52
Paul	And what [is] the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,	53
Paul	Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set [him] at his own right hand in the heavenly [places],	54
Paul	Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:	55
Paul	And hath put all [things] under his feet, and gave him [to be] the head over all [things] to the church,	56
Paul	Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.	57
Paul	And you [hath he quickened], who were dead in trespasses and sins;	58
Paul	Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:	59
Paul	Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.	60
Paul	But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,	61
Paul	Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)	62
Paul	And hath raised [us] up together, and made [us] sit together in heavenly [places] in Christ Jesus:	63
Paul	That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in [his] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.	64
Paul	For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift of God:	65
Paul	Not of works, lest any man should boast.	66
Paul	For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.	67
Paul	Wherefore remember, that ye [being] in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;	68
Paul	That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:	69
Paul	But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.	70
Paul	For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition [between us];	71
Paul	Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, [even] the law of commandments [contained] in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, [so] making peace;	72
Paul	And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:	73
Paul	And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.	74
Paul	For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.	75
Paul	Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;	76
Paul	And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner [stone];	77
Paul	In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:	78
Paul	In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.	79
Paul	For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,	80
Paul	If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:	81
Paul	How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,	82
Paul	Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)	83
Paul	Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;	84
Paul	That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:	85
Paul	Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.	86
Paul	Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;	87
Paul	And to make all [men] see what [is] the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:	88
Paul	To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly [places] might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,	89
Paul	According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:	90
Paul	In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.	91
Paul	Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.	92
Paul	For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,	93
Paul	Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,	94
Paul	That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;	95
Paul	That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,	96
Paul	May be able to comprehend with all saints what [is] the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;	97
Paul	And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.	98
Paul	Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,	99
Paul	Unto him [be] glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end.	100
Paul	Amen.	101
Paul	I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,	102
Paul	With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;	103
Paul	Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.	104
Paul	[There is] one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;	105
Paul	One Lord, one faith, one baptism,	106
Paul	One God and Father of all, who [is] above all, and through all, and in you all.	107
Paul	But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.	108
Paul	Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.	109
Paul	(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?	110
Paul	He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)	111
Paul	And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;	112
Paul	For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:	113
Paul	Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:	114
Paul	That we [henceforth] be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, [and] cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;	115
Paul	But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, [even] Christ:	116
Paul	From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.	117
Paul	This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,	118
Paul	Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:	119
Paul	Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.	120
Paul	But ye have not so learned Christ;	121
Paul	If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:	122
Paul	That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;	123
Paul	And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;	124
Paul	And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.	125
Paul	Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.	126
Paul	Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:	127
Paul	Neither give place to the devil.	128
Paul	Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with [his] hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.	129
Paul	Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.	130
Paul	And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.	131
Paul	Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:	132
Paul	And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.	133
Paul	Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;	134
Paul	And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.	135
Paul	But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;	136
Paul	Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.	137
Paul	For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.	138
Paul	Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.	139
Paul	Be not ye therefore partakers with them.	140
Paul	For ye were sometimes darkness, but now [are ye] light in the Lord: walk as children of light:	141
Paul	(For the fruit of the Spirit [is] in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)	142
Paul	Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.	143
Paul	And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove [them].	144
Paul	For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.	145
Paul	But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.	146
Paul	Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.	147
Paul	See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,	148
Paul	Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.	149
Paul	Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord [is].	150
Paul	And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;	151
Paul	Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;	152
Paul	Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;	153
Paul	Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.	154
Paul	Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.	155
Paul	For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.	156
Paul	Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so [let] the wives [be] to their own husbands in every thing.	157
Paul	Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;	158
Paul	That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,	159
Paul	That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.	160
Paul	So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies.	161
Paul	He that loveth his wife loveth himself.	162
Paul	For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:	163
Paul	For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.	164
Paul	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.	165
Paul	This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.	166
Paul	Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife [see] that she reverence [her] husband.	167
Paul	Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.	168
Paul	Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)	169
Paul	That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.	170
Paul	And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.	171
Paul	Servants, be obedient to them that are [your] masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;	172
Paul	Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;	173
Paul	With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:	174
Paul	Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether [he be] bond or free.	175
Paul	And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.	176
Paul	Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.	177
Paul	Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.	178
Paul	For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high [places].	179
Paul	Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.	180
Paul	Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;	181
Paul	And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;	182
Paul	Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.	183
Paul	And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:	184
Paul	Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;	185
Paul	And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,	186
Paul	For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.	187
Paul	But that ye also may know my affairs, [and] how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:	188
Paul	Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and [that] he might comfort your hearts.	189
Paul	Peace [be] to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	190
Paul	Grace [be] with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.	191
Paul	Amen.	192
Paul	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus [our] brother,	193
Paul	To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	194
Paul	We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,	195
Paul	Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love [which ye have] to all the saints,	196
Paul	For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;	197
Paul	Which is come unto you, as [it is] in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as [it doth] also in you, since the day ye heard [of it], and knew the grace of God in truth:	198
Paul	As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;	199
Paul	Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.	200
Paul	For this cause we also, since the day we heard [it], do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;	201
Paul	That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;	202
Paul	Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;	203
Paul	Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:	204
Paul	Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated [us] into the kingdom of his dear Son:	205
Paul	In whom we have redemption through his blood, [even] the forgiveness of sins:	206
Paul	Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:	207
Paul	For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether [they be] thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:	208
Paul	And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.	209
Paul	And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all [things] he might have the preeminence.	210
Paul	For it pleased [the Father] that in him should all fulness dwell;	211
Paul	And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, [I say], whether [they be] things in earth, or things in heaven.	212
Paul	And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in [your] mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled	213
Paul	In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:	214
Paul	If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and [be] not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, [and] which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;	215
Paul	Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church:	216
Paul	Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;	217
Paul	[Even] the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:	218
Paul	To whom God would make known what [is] the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:	219
Paul	Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:	220
Paul	Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.	221
Paul	For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and [for] them at Laodicea, and [for] as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;	222
Paul	That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;	223
Paul	In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.	224
Paul	And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.	225
Paul	For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.	226
Paul	As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, [so] walk ye in him:	227
Paul	Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.	228
Paul	Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.	229
Paul	For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.	230
Paul	And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:	231
Paul	In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:	232
Paul	Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with [him] through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.	233
Paul	And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;	234
Paul	Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;	235
Paul	[And] having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.	236
Paul	Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath [days]:	237
Paul	Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body [is] of Christ.	238
Paul	Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,	239
Paul	And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.	240
Paul	Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,	241
Paul	(Touch not; taste not; handle not;	242
Paul	Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?	243
Paul	Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.	244
Paul	If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.	245
Paul	Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.	246
Paul	For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.	247
Paul	When Christ, [who is] our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.	248
Paul	Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:	249
Paul	For which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:	250
Paul	In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.	251
Paul	But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.	252
Paul	Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;	253
Paul	And have put on the new [man], which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:	254
Paul	Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond [nor] free: but Christ [is] all, and in all.	255
Paul	Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;	256
Paul	Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also [do] ye.	257
Paul	And above all these things [put on] charity, which is the bond of perfectness.	258
Paul	And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.	259
Paul	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.	260
Paul	And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, [do] all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.	261
Paul	Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.	262
Paul	Husbands, love [your] wives, and be not bitter against them.	263
Paul	Children, obey [your] parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.	264
Paul	Fathers, provoke not your children [to anger], lest they be discouraged.	265
Paul	Servants, obey in all things [your] masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:	266
Paul	And whatsoever ye do, do [it] heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;	267
Paul	Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.	268
Paul	But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.	269
Paul	Masters, give unto [your] servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.	270
Paul	Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;	271
Paul	Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:	272
Paul	That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.	273
Paul	Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.	274
Paul	Let your speech [be] alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.	275
Paul	All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, [who is] a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:	276
Paul	Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;	277
Paul	With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is [one] of you.	278
Paul	They shall make known unto you all things which [are done] here.	279
Paul	Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister’s son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)	280
Paul	And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision.	281
Paul	These only [are my] fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.	282
Paul	Epaphras, who is [one] of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.	283
Paul	For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them [that are] in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.	284
Paul	Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.	285
Paul	Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.	286
Paul	And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the [epistle] from Laodicea.	287
Paul	And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.	288
Paul	The salutation by the hand of me Paul.	289
Paul	Remember my bonds.	290
Paul	Grace [be] with you.	291
Paul	Amen.	292
Paul	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:	293
Paul	Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	294
Paul	We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;	295
Paul	So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:	296
Paul	[Which is] a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:	297
Paul	Seeing [it is] a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;	298
Paul	And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,	299
Paul	In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:	300
Paul	Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;	301
Paul	When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.	302
Paul	Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of [this] calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of [his] goodness, and the work of faith with power:	303
Paul	That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.	304
Paul	Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and [by] our gathering together unto him,	305
Paul	That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.	306
Paul	Let no man deceive you by any means: for [that day shall not come], except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;	307
Paul	Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.	308
Paul	Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?	309
Paul	And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.	310
Paul	For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth [will let], until he be taken out of the way.	311
Paul	And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:	312
Paul	[Even him], whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,	313
Paul	And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.	314
Paul	And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:	315
Paul	That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.	316
Paul	But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:	317
Paul	Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.	318
Paul	Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.	319
Paul	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given [us] everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,	320
Paul	Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.	321
Paul	Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have [free] course, and be glorified, even as [it is] with you:	322
Paul	And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all [men] have not faith.	323
Paul	But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep [you] from evil.	324
Paul	And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.	325
Paul	And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.	326
Paul	Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.	327
Paul	For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;	328
Paul	Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:	329
Paul	Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.	330
Paul	For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.	331
Paul	For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.	332
Paul	Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.	333
Paul	But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.	334
Paul	And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.	335
Paul	Yet count [him] not as an enemy, but admonish [him] as a brother.	336
Paul	Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means.	337
Paul	The Lord [be] with you all.	338
Paul	The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.	339
Paul	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all.	340
Paul	Amen.	341
Paul	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, [which is] our hope;	342
Paul	Unto Timothy, [my] own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.	343
Paul	As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,	344
Paul	Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: [so do].	345
Paul	Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and [of] a good conscience, and [of] faith unfeigned:	346
Paul	From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;	347
Paul	Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.	348
Paul	But we know that the law [is] good, if a man use it lawfully;	349
Paul	Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,	350
Paul	For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;	351
Paul	According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.	352
Paul	And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;	353
Paul	Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did [it] ignorantly in unbelief.	354
Paul	And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.	355
Paul	This [is] a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.	356
Paul	Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.	357
Paul	Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, [be] honour and glory for ever and ever.	358
Paul	Amen.	359
Paul	This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;	360
Paul	Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:	361
Paul	Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.	362
Paul	I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, [and] giving of thanks, be made for all men;	363
Paul	For kings, and [for] all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.	364
Paul	For this [is] good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;	365
Paul	Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.	366
Paul	For [there is] one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;	367
Paul	Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.	368
Paul	Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, [and] lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.	369
Paul	I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.	370
Paul	In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;	371
Paul	But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.	372
Paul	Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.	373
Paul	But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.	374
Paul	For Adam was first formed, then Eve.	375
Paul	And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.	376
Paul	Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.	377
Paul	This [is] a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.	378
Paul	A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;	379
Paul	Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;	380
Paul	One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;	381
Paul	(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)	382
Paul	Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.	383
Paul	Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.	384
Paul	Likewise [must] the deacons [be] grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;	385
Paul	Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.	386
Paul	And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being [found] blameless.	387
Paul	Even so [must their] wives [be] grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.	388
Paul	Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.	389
Paul	For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.	390
Paul	These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:	391
Paul	But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.	392
Paul	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.	393
Paul	Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;	394
Paul	Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;	395
Paul	Forbidding to marry, [and commanding] to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.	396
Paul	For every creature of God [is] good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:	397
Paul	For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.	398
Paul	If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.	399
Paul	But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself [rather] unto godliness.	400
Paul	For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.	401
Paul	This [is] a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.	402
Paul	For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.	403
Paul	These things command and teach.	404
Paul	Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.	405
Paul	Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.	406
Paul	Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.	407
Paul	Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.	408
Paul	Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.	409
Paul	Rebuke not an elder, but intreat [him] as a father; [and] the younger men as brethren;	410
Paul	The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.	411
Paul	Honour widows that are widows indeed.	412
Paul	But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.	413
Paul	Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.	414
Paul	But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.	415
Paul	And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.	416
Paul	But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.	417
Paul	Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,	418
Paul	Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints’ feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.	419
Paul	But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;	420
Paul	Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.	421
Paul	And withal they learn [to be] idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.	422
Paul	I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.	423
Paul	For some are already turned aside after Satan.	424
Paul	If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.	425
Paul	Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.	426
Paul	For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn.	427
Paul	And, The labourer [is] worthy of his reward.	428
Paul	Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.	429
Paul	Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.	430
Paul	I charge [thee] before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.	431
Paul	Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure.	432
Paul	Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities.	433
Paul	Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some [men] they follow after.	434
Paul	Likewise also the good works [of some] are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.	435
Paul	Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and [his] doctrine be not blasphemed.	436
Paul	And they that have believing masters, let them not despise [them], because they are brethren; but rather do [them] service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit.	437
Paul	These things teach and exhort.	438
Paul	If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, [even] the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;	439
Paul	He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,	440
Paul	Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.	441
Paul	But godliness with contentment is great gain.	442
Paul	For we brought nothing into [this] world, [and it is] certain we can carry nothing out.	443
Paul	And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.	444
Paul	But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and [into] many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.	445
Paul	For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.	446
Paul	But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.	447
Paul	Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.	448
Paul	I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and [before] Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;	449
Paul	That thou keep [this] commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:	450
Paul	Which in his times he shall shew, [who is] the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;	451
Paul	Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom [be] honour and power everlasting.	452
Paul	Amen.	453
Paul	Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;	454
Paul	That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;	455
Paul	Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.	456
Paul	O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane [and] vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:	457
Paul	Which some professing have erred concerning the faith.	458
Paul	Grace [be] with thee.	459
Paul	Amen.	460
Paul	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,	461
Paul	To Timothy, [my] dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.	462
Paul	I thank God, whom I serve from [my] forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;	463
Paul	Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;	464
Paul	When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.	465
Paul	Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.	466
Paul	For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.	467
Paul	Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;	468
Paul	Who hath saved us, and called [us] with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,	469
Paul	But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:	470
Paul	Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.	471
Paul	For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.	472
Paul	Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.	473
Paul	That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.	474
Paul	This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.	475
Paul	The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:	476
Paul	But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found [me].	477
Paul	The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.	478
Paul	Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.	479
Paul	And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.	480
Paul	Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.	481
Paul	No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of [this] life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.	482
Paul	And if a man also strive for masteries, [yet] is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.	483
Paul	The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.	484
Paul	Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.	485
Paul	Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:	486
Paul	Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, [even] unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.	487
Paul	Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.	488
Paul	[It is] a faithful saying: For if we be dead with [him], we shall also live with [him]:	489
Paul	If we suffer, we shall also reign with [him]: if we deny [him], he also will deny us:	490
Paul	If we believe not, [yet] he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.	491
Paul	Of these things put [them] in remembrance, charging [them] before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, [but] to the subverting of the hearers.	492
Paul	Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.	493
Paul	But shun profane [and] vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.	494
Paul	And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;	495
Paul	Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.	496
Paul	Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his.	497
Paul	And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.	498
Paul	But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.	499
Paul	If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, [and] prepared unto every good work.	500
Paul	Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.	501
Paul	But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.	502
Paul	And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all [men], apt to teach, patient,	503
Paul	In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;	504
Paul	And [that] they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.	505
Paul	This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.	506
Paul	For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,	507
Paul	Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,	508
Paul	Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;	509
Paul	Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.	510
Paul	For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,	511
Paul	Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.	512
Paul	Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.	513
Paul	But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all [men], as theirs also was.	514
Paul	But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,	515
Paul	Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of [them] all the Lord delivered me.	516
Paul	Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.	517
Paul	But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.	518
Paul	But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned [them];	519
Paul	And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.	520
Paul	All scripture [is] given by inspiration of God, and [is] profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:	521
Paul	That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.	522
Paul	I charge [thee] therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;	523
Paul	Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.	524
Paul	For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;	525
Paul	And they shall turn away [their] ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.	526
Paul	But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.	527
Paul	For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.	528
Paul	I have fought a good fight, I have finished [my] course, I have kept the faith:	529
Paul	Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.	530
Paul	Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:	531
Paul	For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.	532
Paul	Only Luke is with me.	533
Paul	Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.	534
Paul	And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.	535
Paul	The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring [with thee], and the books, [but] especially the parchments.	536
Paul	Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:	537
Paul	Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.	538
Paul	At my first answer no man stood with me, but all [men] forsook me: [I pray God] that it may not be laid to their charge.	539
Paul	Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and [that] all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.	540
Paul	And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve [me] unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom [be] glory for ever and ever.	541
Paul	Amen.	542
Paul	Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.	543
Paul	Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.	544
Paul	Do thy diligence to come before winter.	545
Paul	Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.	546
Paul	The Lord Jesus Christ [be] with thy spirit.	547
Paul	Grace [be] with you.	548
Paul	Amen.	549
Paul	Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;	550
Paul	In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;	551
Paul	But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;	552
Paul	To Titus, [mine] own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.	553
Paul	For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:	554
Paul	If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.	555
Paul	For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;	556
Paul	But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;	557
Paul	Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.	558
Paul	For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:	559
Paul	Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.	560
Paul	One of themselves, [even] a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians [are] alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.	561
Paul	This witness is true.	562
Paul	Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;	563
Paul	Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.	564
Paul	Unto the pure all things [are] pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving [is] nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.	565
Paul	They profess that they know God; but in works they deny [him], being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.	566
Paul	But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:	567
Paul	That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.	568
Paul	The aged women likewise, that [they be] in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;	569
Paul	That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,	570
Paul	[To be] discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.	571
Paul	Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.	572
Paul	In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine [shewing] uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,	573
Paul	Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.	574
Paul	[Exhort] servants to be obedient unto their own masters, [and] to please [them] well in all [things]; not answering again;	575
Paul	Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.	576
Paul	For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,	577
Paul	Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;	578
Paul	Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;	579
Paul	Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.	580
Paul	These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.	581
Paul	Let no man despise thee.	582
Paul	Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,	583
Paul	To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, [but] gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.	584
Paul	For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, [and] hating one another.	585
Paul	But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,	586
Paul	Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;	587
Paul	Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;	588
Paul	That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.	589
Paul	[This is] a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works.	590
Paul	These things are good and profitable unto men.	591
Paul	But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.	592
Paul	A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;	593
Paul	Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.	594
Paul	When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.	595
Paul	Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.	596
Paul	And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.	597
Paul	All that are with me salute thee.	598
Paul	Greet them that love us in the faith.	599
Paul	Grace [be] with you all.	600
Paul	Amen.	601
Paul	God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,	602
Paul	Hath in these last days spoken unto us by [his] Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;	603
Paul	Who being the brightness of [his] glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;	604
Paul	Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.	605
Paul	For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?	606
Paul	And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?	607
Paul	And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.	608
Paul	And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.	609
Paul	But unto the Son [he saith], Thy throne, O God, [is] for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness [is] the sceptre of thy kingdom.	610
Paul	Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, [even] thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.	611
Paul	And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:	612
Paul	They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;	613
Paul	And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.	614
Paul	But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?	615
Paul	Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?	616
Paul	Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let [them] slip.	617
Paul	For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;	618
Paul	How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard [him];	619
Paul	God also bearing [them] witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?	620
Paul	For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.	621
Paul	But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him?	622
Paul	or the son of man, that thou visitest him?	623
Paul	Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:	624
Paul	Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet.	625
Paul	For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing [that is] not put under him.	626
Paul	But now we see not yet all things put under him.	627
Paul	But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.	628
Paul	For it became him, for whom [are] all things, and by whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.	629
Paul	For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified [are] all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,	630
Paul	Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.	631
Paul	And again, I will put my trust in him.	632
Paul	And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.	633
Paul	Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;	634
Paul	And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.	635
Paul	For verily he took not on [him the nature of] angels; but he took on [him] the seed of Abraham.	636
Paul	Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto [his] brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things [pertaining] to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.	637
Paul	For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.	638
Paul	Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;	639
Paul	Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses [was faithful] in all his house.	640
Paul	For this [man] was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.	641
Paul	For every house is builded by some [man]; but he that built all things [is] God.	642
Paul	And Moses verily [was] faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;	643
Paul	But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.	644
Paul	Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,	645
Paul	Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:	646
Paul	When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.	647
Paul	Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in [their] heart; and they have not known my ways.	648
Paul	So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)	649
Paul	Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.	650
Paul	But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.	651
Paul	For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;	652
Paul	While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.	653
Paul	For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.	654
Paul	But with whom was he grieved forty years?	655
Paul	[was it] not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?	656
Paul	And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?	657
Paul	So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.	658
Paul	Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left [us] of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.	659
Paul	For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard [it].	660
Paul	For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.	661
Paul	For he spake in a certain place of the seventh [day] on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.	662
Paul	And in this [place] again, If they shall enter into my rest.	663
Paul	Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:	664
Paul	Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.	665
Paul	For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.	666
Paul	There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.	667
Paul	For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God [did] from his.	668
Paul	Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.	669
Paul	For the word of God [is] quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and [is] a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.	670
Paul	Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things [are] naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.	671
Paul	Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast [our] profession.	672
Paul	For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin.	673
Paul	Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.	674
Paul	For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things [pertaining] to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:	675
Paul	Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.	676
Paul	And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.	677
Paul	And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as [was] Aaron.	678
Paul	So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.	679
Paul	As he saith also in another [place], Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.	680
Paul	Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;	681
Paul	Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;	682
Paul	And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;	683
Paul	Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.	684
Paul	Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.	685
Paul	For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which [be] the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.	686
Paul	For every one that useth milk [is] unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.	687
Paul	But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, [even] those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.	688
Paul	Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,	689
Paul	Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.	690
Paul	And this will we do, if God permit.	691
Paul	For [it is] impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,	692
Paul	And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,	693
Paul	If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put [him] to an open shame.	694
Paul	For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:	695
Paul	But that which beareth thorns and briers [is] rejected, and [is] nigh unto cursing; whose end [is] to be burned.	696
Paul	But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.	697
Paul	For God [is] not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.	698
Paul	And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:	699
Paul	That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.	700
Paul	For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,	701
Paul	Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.	702
Paul	And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.	703
Paul	For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation [is] to them an end of all strife.	704
Paul	Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed [it] by an oath:	705
Paul	That by two immutable things, in which [it was] impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:	706
Paul	Which [hope] we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;	707
Paul	Whither the forerunner is for us entered, [even] Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.	708
Paul	For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;	709
Paul	To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;	710
Paul	Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.	711
Paul	Now consider how great this man [was], unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.	712
Paul	And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:	713
Paul	But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.	714
Paul	And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.	715
Paul	And here men that die receive tithes; but there he [receiveth them], of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.	716
Paul	And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.	717
Paul	For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.	718
Paul	If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need [was there] that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?	719
Paul	For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.	720
Paul	For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.	721
Paul	For [it is] evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.	722
Paul	And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,	723
Paul	Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.	724
Paul	For he testifieth, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.	725
Paul	For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.	726
Paul	For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope [did]; by the which we draw nigh unto God.	727
Paul	And inasmuch as not without an oath [he was made priest]:	728
Paul	(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)	729
Paul	By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.	730
Paul	And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:	731
Paul	But this [man], because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.	732
Paul	Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.	733
Paul	For such an high priest became us, [who is] holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;	734
Paul	Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.	735
Paul	For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, [maketh] the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.	736
Paul	Now of the things which we have spoken [this is] the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;	737
Paul	A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.	738
Paul	For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore [it is] of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.	739
Paul	For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:	740
Paul	Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, [that] thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.	741
Paul	But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.	742
Paul	For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.	743
Paul	For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:	744
Paul	Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.	745
Paul	For this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:	746
Paul	And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.	747
Paul	For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.	748
Paul	In that he saith, A new [covenant], he hath made the first old.	749
Paul	Now that which decayeth and waxeth old [is] ready to vanish away.	750
Paul	Then verily the first [covenant] had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.	751
Paul	For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein [was] the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.	752
Paul	And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;	753
Paul	Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein [was] the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;	754
Paul	And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.	755
Paul	Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service [of God].	756
Paul	But into the second [went] the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and [for] the errors of the people:	757
Paul	The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:	758
Paul	Which [was] a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;	759
Paul	[Which stood] only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed [on them] until the time of reformation.	760
Paul	But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;	761
Paul	Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption [for us].	762
Paul	For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:	763
Paul	How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?	764
Paul	And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions [that were] under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.	765
Paul	For where a testament [is], there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.	766
Paul	For a testament [is] of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.	767
Paul	Whereupon neither the first [testament] was dedicated without blood.	768
Paul	For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,	769
Paul	Saying, This [is] the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.	770
Paul	Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.	771
Paul	And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.	772
Paul	[It was] therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.	773
Paul	For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, [which are] the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:	774
Paul	Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;	775
Paul	For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.	776
Paul	And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:	777
Paul	So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.	778
Paul	For the law having a shadow of good things to come, [and] not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.	779
Paul	For then would they not have ceased to be offered?	780
Paul	because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.	781
Paul	But in those [sacrifices there is] a remembrance again [made] of sins every year.	782
Paul	For [it is] not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.	783
Paul	Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:	784
Paul	In burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin thou hast had no pleasure.	785
Paul	Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.	786
Paul	Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and [offering] for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure [therein]; which are offered by the law;	787
Paul	Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.	788
Paul	He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.	789
Paul	By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once [for all].	790
Paul	And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:	791
Paul	But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;	792
Paul	From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.	793
Paul	For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.	794
Paul	[Whereof] the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,	795
Paul	This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;	796
Paul	And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.	797
Paul	Now where remission of these [is, there is] no more offering for sin.	798
Paul	Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,	799
Paul	By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;	800
Paul	And [having] an high priest over the house of God;	801
Paul	Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.	802
Paul	Let us hold fast the profession of [our] faith without wavering; (for he [is] faithful that promised;)	803
Paul	And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:	804
Paul	Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some [is]; but exhorting [one another]: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.	805
Paul	For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,	806
Paul	But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.	807
Paul	He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:	808
Paul	Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?	809
Paul	For we know him that hath said, Vengeance [belongeth] unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord.	810
Paul	And again, The Lord shall judge his people.	811
Paul	[It is] a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.	812
Paul	But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;	813
Paul	Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.	814
Paul	For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.	815
Paul	Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.	816
Paul	For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.	817
Paul	For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.	818
Paul	Now the just shall live by faith: but if [any man] draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.	819
Paul	But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.	820
Paul	Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.	821
Paul	For by it the elders obtained a good report.	822
Paul	Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.	823
Paul	By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.	824
Paul	By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.	825
Paul	But without faith [it is] impossible to please [him]: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.	826
Paul	By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.	827
Paul	By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.	828
Paul	By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as [in] a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:	829
Paul	For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker [is] God.	830
Paul	Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.	831
Paul	Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, [so many] as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.	832
Paul	These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of [them], and embraced [them], and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.	833
Paul	For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.	834
Paul	And truly, if they had been mindful of that [country] from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.	835
Paul	But now they desire a better [country], that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.	836
Paul	By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten [son],	837
Paul	Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:	838
Paul	Accounting that God [was] able to raise [him] up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.	839
Paul	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.	840
Paul	By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, [leaning] upon the top of his staff.	841
Paul	By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.	842
Paul	By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw [he was] a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.	843
Paul	By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;	844
Paul	Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;	845
Paul	Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.	846
Paul	By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.	847
Paul	Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.	848
Paul	By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry [land]: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.	849
Paul	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.	850
Paul	By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.	851
Paul	And what shall I more say?	852
Paul	for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and [of] Barak, and [of] Samson, and [of] Jephthae; [of] David also, and Samuel, and [of] the prophets:	853
Paul	Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,	854
Paul	Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.	855
Paul	Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:	856
Paul	And others had trial of [cruel] mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:	857
Paul	They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;	858
Paul	(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and [in] mountains, and [in] dens and caves of the earth.	859
Paul	And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:	860
Paul	God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.	861
Paul	Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset [us], and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,	862
Paul	Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of [our] faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.	863
Paul	For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.	864
Paul	Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.	865
Paul	And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:	866
Paul	For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.	867
Paul	If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?	868
Paul	But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.	869
Paul	Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected [us], and we gave [them] reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?	870
Paul	For they verily for a few days chastened [us] after their own pleasure; but he for [our] profit, that [we] might be partakers of his holiness.	871
Paul	Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.	872
Paul	Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;	873
Paul	And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.	874
Paul	Follow peace with all [men], and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:	875
Paul	Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble [you], and thereby many be defiled;	876
Paul	Lest there [be] any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.	877
Paul	For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.	878
Paul	For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,	879
Paul	And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which [voice] they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:	880
Paul	(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:	881
Paul	And so terrible was the sight, [that] Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)	882
Paul	But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,	883
Paul	To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,	884
Paul	And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than [that of] Abel.	885
Paul	See that ye refuse not him that speaketh.	886
Paul	For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more [shall not] we [escape], if we turn away from him that [speaketh] from heaven:	887
Paul	Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.	888
Paul	And this [word], Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.	889
Paul	Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:	890
Paul	For our God [is] a consuming fire.	891
Paul	Let brotherly love continue.	892
Paul	Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.	893
Paul	Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; [and] them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.	894
Paul	Marriage [is] honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.	895
Paul	[Let your] conversation [be] without covetousness; [and be] content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.	896
Paul	So that we may boldly say, The Lord [is] my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.	897
Paul	Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of [their] conversation.	898
Paul	Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.	899
Paul	Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines.	900
Paul	For [it is] a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.	901
Paul	We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.	902
Paul	For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.	903
Paul	Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.	904
Paul	Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.	905
Paul	For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.	906
Paul	By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of [our] lips giving thanks to his name.	907
Paul	But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.	908
Paul	Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that [is] unprofitable for you.	909
Paul	Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.	910
Paul	But I beseech [you] the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.	911
Paul	Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,	912
Paul	Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom [be] glory for ever and ever.	913
Paul	Amen.	914
Paul	And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.	915
Paul	Know ye that [our] brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.	916
Paul	Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints.	917
Paul	They of Italy salute you.	918
Paul	Grace [be] with you all.	919
Paul	Amen.	920
Peter	Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:	921
Peter	Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,	922
Peter	According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that [pertain] unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:	923
Peter	Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.	924
Peter	And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;	925
Peter	And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;	926
Peter	And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.	927
Peter	For if these things be in you, and abound, they make [you that ye shall] neither [be] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.	928
Peter	But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.	929
Peter	Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:	930
Peter	For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.	931
Peter	Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know [them], and be established in the present truth.	932
Peter	Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting [you] in remembrance;	933
Peter	Knowing that shortly I must put off [this] my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.	934
Peter	Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.	935
Peter	For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.	936
Peter	For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.	937
Peter	And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.	938
Peter	We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:	939
Peter	Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.	940
Peter	For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake [as they were] moved by the Holy Ghost.	941
Peter	But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.	942
Peter	And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.	943
Peter	And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.	944
Peter	For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast [them] down to hell, and delivered [them] into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;	945
Peter	And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth [person], a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;	946
Peter	And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned [them] with an overthrow, making [them] an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;	947
Peter	And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:	948
Peter	(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed [his] righteous soul from day to day with [their] unlawful deeds;)	949
Peter	The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:	950
Peter	But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government.	951
Peter	Presumptuous [are they], selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.	952
Peter	Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.	953
Peter	But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;	954
Peter	And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, [as] they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time.	955
Peter	Spots [they are] and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;	956
Peter	Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:	957
Peter	Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam [the son] of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;	958
Peter	But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man’s voice forbad the madness of the prophet.	959
Peter	These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.	960
Peter	For when they speak great swelling [words] of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, [through much] wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.	961
Peter	While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.	962
Peter	For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.	963
Peter	For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known [it], to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.	964
Peter	But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog [is] turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.	965
Peter	This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in [both] which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:	966
Peter	That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:	967
Peter	Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,	968
Peter	And saying, Where is the promise of his coming?	969
Peter	for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as [they were] from the beginning of the creation.	970
Peter	For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:	971
Peter	Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:	972
Peter	But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.	973
Peter	But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day [is] with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.	974
Peter	The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.	975
Peter	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.	976
Peter	[Seeing] then [that] all these things shall be dissolved, what manner [of persons] ought ye to be in [all] holy conversation and godliness,	977
Peter	Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?	978
Peter	Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.	979
Peter	Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.	980
Peter	And account [that] the longsuffering of our Lord [is] salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;	981
Peter	As also in all [his] epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as [they do] also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.	982
Peter	Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know [these things] before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.	983
Peter	But grow in grace, and [in] the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.	984
Peter	To him [be] glory both now and for ever.	985
Peter	Amen.	986
