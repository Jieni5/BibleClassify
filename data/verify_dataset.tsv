John	And let him that heareth say, Come.	4740
John	And let him that heareth say, Come.	4741
John	And let him that heareth say, Come.	4742
John	And let him that is athirst come.	4743
John	And let him that is athirst come.	4744
John	And let him that is athirst come.	4745
John	And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.	4746
John	And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.	4747
John	And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.	4748
John	For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:	4749
John	For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:	4750
John	For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:	4751
John	And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and [from] the things which are written in this book.	4752
John	And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and [from] the things which are written in this book.	4753

John	Even so, come, Lord Jesus.	4758
John	Even so, come, Lord Jesus.	4759
John	Even so, come, Lord Jesus.	4760
John	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all.	4761
John	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all.	4762
John	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all.	4763
Paul	But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.	4764
Paul	Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.	4765
Paul	But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.	4766
Paul	Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.	4767
Paul	For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.	4768
Paul	For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.	4769
Paul	I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.	4770
Paul	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:	4771
Paul	Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.	4772
Paul	Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord.	4773
Paul	To write the same things to you, to me indeed [is] not grievous, but for you [it is] safe.	4774
Paul	Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.	4775
Paul	For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.	4776
Paul	Though I might also have confidence in the flesh.	4777
Paul	If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:	4778
Paul	Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, [of] the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;	4779
Paul	Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.	4780
Paul	But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.	4781
Paul	Yea doubtless, and I count all things [but] loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them [but] dung, that I may win Christ,	4782
Paul	And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:	4783
Paul	That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;	4784
Paul	If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.	4785
Paul	Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.	4786
Paul	Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but [this] one thing [I do], forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,	4787
Paul	I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.	4788
Paul	Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.	4789
Paul	Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.	4790
Paul	Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.	4791
Paul	(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, [that they are] the enemies of the cross of Christ:	4792
Paul	Whose end [is] destruction, whose God [is their] belly, and [whose] glory [is] in their shame, who mind earthly things.)	4793
Paul	For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:	4794
Paul	Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.	4795
Paul	Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, [my] dearly beloved.	4796
Paul	I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.	4797
Paul	And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and [with] other my fellowlabourers, whose names [are] in the book of life.	4798
Paul	Rejoice in the Lord alway: [and] again I say, Rejoice.	4799
Paul	Let your moderation be known unto all men.	4800
Paul	The Lord [is] at hand.	4801
Paul	Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.	4802
Paul	And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.	4803
Paul	Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things [are] honest, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] lovely, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue, and if [there be] any praise, think on these things.	4804
Paul	Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.	4805
Paul	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.	4806
Paul	Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, [therewith] to be content.	4807
Paul	I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.	4808
Paul	I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.	4809
Paul	Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.	4810
Paul	Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.	4811
Paul	For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.	4812
Paul	Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.	4813
Paul	But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things [which were sent] from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.	4814
Paul	But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.	4815
Paul	Now unto God and our Father [be] glory for ever and ever.	4816
Paul	Salute every saint in Christ Jesus.	4817
Paul	The brethren which are with me greet you.	4818
Paul	All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar’s household.	4819
Paul	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all.	4820
Paul	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians [which is] in God the Father and [in] the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.	4821
Paul	We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;	4822
Paul	Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;	4823
Paul	Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.	4824
Paul	For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.	4825
Paul	And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:	4826
Paul	So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.	4827
Paul	For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.	4828
Paul	For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;	4829
Paul	And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, [even] Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.	4830
Paul	For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:	4831
Paul	But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.	4832
Paul	For our exhortation [was] not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:	4833
Paul	But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.	4834
Paul	For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God [is] witness:	4835
Paul	Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor [yet] of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.	4836
Paul	But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:	4837
Paul	So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.	4838
Paul	For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.	4839
Paul	Ye [are] witnesses, and God [also], how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:	4840
Paul	As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father [doth] his children,	4841
Paul	That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.	4842
Paul	For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received [it] not [as] the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.	4843
Paul	For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they [have] of the Jews:	4844
Paul	Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:	4845
Paul	Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.	4846
Paul	But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.	4847
Paul	Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.	4848
Paul	For what [is] our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing?	4849
Paul	[Are] not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?	4850
Paul	For ye are our glory and joy.	4851
Paul	Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;	4852
Paul	And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:	4853
Paul	That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.	4854
Paul	For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.	4855
Paul	For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.	4856
Paul	But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also [to see] you:	4857
Paul	Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:	4858
Paul	For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.	4859
Paul	For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;	4860
Paul	Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?	4861
Paul	Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.	4862
Paul	And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all [men], even as we [do] toward you:	4863
Paul	To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.	4864
Paul	Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort [you] by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, [so] ye would abound more and more.	4865
Paul	For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.	4866
Paul	For this is the will of God, [even] your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:	4867
Paul	That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;	4868
Paul	Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:	4869
Paul	That no [man] go beyond and defraud his brother in [any] matter: because that the Lord [is] the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.	4870
Paul	For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.	4871
Paul	He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.	4872
Paul	But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.	4873
Paul	And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;	4874
Paul	And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;	4875
Paul	That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and [that] ye may have lack of nothing.	4876
Paul	But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.	4877
Paul	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.	4878
Paul	For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive [and] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.	4879
Paul	For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:	4880
Paul	Then we which are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.	4881
Paul	Wherefore comfort one another with these words.	4882
Paul	But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.	4883
Paul	For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.	4884
Paul	For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.	4885
Paul	But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.	4886
Paul	Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.	4887
Paul	Therefore let us not sleep, as [do] others; but let us watch and be sober.	4888
Paul	For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.	4889
Paul	But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.	4890
Paul	For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,	4891
Paul	Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.	4892
Paul	Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.	4893
Paul	And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;	4894
Paul	And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake.	4895
Paul	[And] be at peace among yourselves.	4896
Paul	Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all [men].	4897
Paul	See that none render evil for evil unto any [man]; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all [men].	4898
Paul	Rejoice evermore.	4899
Paul	Pray without ceasing.	4900
Paul	In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.	4901
Paul	Quench not the Spirit.	4902
Paul	Despise not prophesyings.	4903
Paul	Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.	4904
Paul	Abstain from all appearance of evil.	4905
Paul	And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and [I pray God] your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.	4906
Paul	Faithful [is] he that calleth you, who also will do [it].	4907
Paul	Brethren, pray for us.	4908
Paul	Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.	4909
Paul	I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.	4910
Paul	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you.	4911
Paul	Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy [our] brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,	4912
Paul	And to [our] beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:	4913
Paul	Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	4914
Paul	I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,	4915
Paul	Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;	4916
Paul	That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.	4917
Paul	For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.	4918
Paul	Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,	4919
Paul	Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech [thee], being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.	4920
Paul	I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:	4921
Paul	Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:	4922
Paul	Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:	4923
Paul	Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:	4924
Paul	But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.	4925
Paul	For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;	4926
Paul	Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?	4927
Paul	If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.	4928
Paul	If he hath wronged thee, or oweth [thee] ought, put that on mine account;	4929
Paul	I Paul have written [it] with mine own hand, I will repay [it]: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.	4930
Paul	Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.	4931
Paul	Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.	4932
Paul	But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.	4933
Paul	There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;	4934
Paul	Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.	4935
Paul	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit.	4936
Peter	Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder.	4937
Peter	Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder.	4938
