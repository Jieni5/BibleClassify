Matthew	But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, [yet] found they none.	0
Matthew	At the last came two false witnesses,	1
Matthew	And said, This [fellow] said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.	2
Matthew	And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing?	3
Matthew	what [is it which] these witness against thee?	4
Matthew	But Jesus held his peace.	5
Matthew	And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.	6
Matthew	Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.	7
Matthew	Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses?	8
Matthew	behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.	9
Matthew	What think ye?	10
Matthew	They answered and said, He is guilty of death.	11
Matthew	Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote [him] with the palms of their hands,	12
Matthew	Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?	13
Matthew	Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.	14
Matthew	But he denied before [them] all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.	15
Matthew	And when he was gone out into the porch, another [maid] saw him, and said unto them that were there, This [fellow] was also with Jesus of Nazareth.	16
Matthew	And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.	17
Matthew	And after a while came unto [him] they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art [one] of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.	18
Matthew	Then began he to curse and to swear, [saying], I know not the man.	19
Matthew	And immediately the cock crew.	20
Matthew	And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.	21
Matthew	And he went out, and wept bitterly.	22
Matthew	When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:	23
Matthew	And when they had bound him, they led [him] away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.	24
Matthew	Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,	25
Matthew	Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood.	26
Matthew	And they said, What [is that] to us?	27
Matthew	see thou [to that].	28
Matthew	And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.	29
Matthew	And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.	30
Matthew	And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.	31
Matthew	Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.	32
Matthew	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;	33
Matthew	And gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.	34
Matthew	And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews?	35
Matthew	And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.	36
Matthew	And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.	37
Matthew	Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?	38
Matthew	And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.	39
Matthew	Now at [that] feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.	40
Matthew	And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.	41
Matthew	Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you?	42
Matthew	Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?	43
Matthew	For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.	44
Matthew	When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.	45
Matthew	But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.	46
Matthew	The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you?	47
Matthew	They said, Barabbas.	48
Matthew	Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ?	49
Matthew	[They] all say unto him, Let him be crucified.	50
Matthew	And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done?	51
Matthew	But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.	52
Matthew	When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but [that] rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed [his] hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye [to it].	53
Matthew	Then answered all the people, and said, His blood [be] on us, and on our children.	54
Matthew	Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered [him] to be crucified.	55
Matthew	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band [of soldiers].	56
Matthew	And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.	57
Matthew	And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put [it] upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!	58
Matthew	And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.	59
Matthew	And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify [him].	60
Matthew	And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.	61
Matthew	And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,	62
Matthew	They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted [thereof], he would not drink.	63
Matthew	And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.	64
Matthew	And sitting down they watched him there;	65
Matthew	And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.	66
Matthew	Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.	67
Matthew	And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,	68
Matthew	And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest [it] in three days, save thyself.	69
Matthew	If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.	70
Matthew	Likewise also the chief priests mocking [him], with the scribes and elders, said,	71
Matthew	He saved others; himself he cannot save.	72
Matthew	If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.	73
Matthew	He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.	74
Matthew	The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.	75
Matthew	Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.	76
Matthew	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?	77
Matthew	that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?	78
Matthew	Some of them that stood there, when they heard [that], said, This [man] calleth for Elias.	79
Matthew	And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled [it] with vinegar, and put [it] on a reed, and gave him to drink.	80
Matthew	The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.	81
Matthew	Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.	82
Matthew	And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;	83
Matthew	And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,	84
Matthew	And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.	85
Matthew	Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.	86
Matthew	And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:	87
Matthew	Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children.	88
Matthew	When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:	89
Matthew	He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.	90
Matthew	Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.	91
Matthew	And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,	92
Matthew	And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.	93
Matthew	And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.	94
Matthew	Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,	95
Matthew	Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.	96
Matthew	Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.	97
Matthew	Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make [it] as sure as ye can.	98
Matthew	So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.	99
Matthew	In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first [day] of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.	100
Matthew	And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.	101
Matthew	His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:	102
Matthew	And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead [men].	103
Matthew	And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.	104
Matthew	He is not here: for he is risen, as he said.	105
Matthew	Come, see the place where the Lord lay.	106
Matthew	And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.	107
Matthew	And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.	108
Matthew	And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail.	109
Matthew	And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.	110
Matthew	Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.	111
Matthew	Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.	112
Matthew	And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,	113
Matthew	Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him [away] while we slept.	114
Matthew	And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.	115
Matthew	So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.	116
Matthew	Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.	117
Matthew	And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.	118
Matthew	And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.	119
Matthew	Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:	120
Matthew	Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, [even] unto the end of the world.	121
Matthew	Amen.	122
Mark	And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art [one] of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth [thereto].	123
Mark	But he began to curse and to swear, [saying], I know not this man of whom ye speak.	124
Mark	And the second time the cock crew.	125
Mark	And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.	126
Mark	And when he thought thereon, he wept.	127
Mark	And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried [him] away, and delivered [him] to Pilate.	128
Mark	And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews?	129
Mark	And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest [it].	130
Mark	And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.	131
Mark	And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing?	132
Mark	behold how many things they witness against thee.	133
Mark	But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.	134
Mark	Now at [that] feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.	135
Mark	And there was [one] named Barabbas, [which lay] bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.	136
Mark	And the multitude crying aloud began to desire [him to do] as he had ever done unto them.	137
Mark	But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?	138
Mark	For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.	139
Mark	But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.	140
Mark	And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do [unto him] whom ye call the King of the Jews?	141
Mark	And they cried out again, Crucify him.	142
Mark	Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done?	143
Mark	And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.	144
Mark	And [so] Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged [him], to be crucified.	145
Mark	And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.	146
Mark	And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his [head],	147
Mark	And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!	148
Mark	And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing [their] knees worshipped him.	149
Mark	And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.	150
Mark	And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.	151
Mark	And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.	152
Mark	And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received [it] not.	153
Mark	And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.	154
Mark	And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.	155
Mark	And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.	156
Mark	And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.	157
Mark	And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.	158
Mark	And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest [it] in three days,	159
Mark	Save thyself, and come down from the cross.	160
Mark	Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.	161
Mark	Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe.	162
Mark	And they that were crucified with him reviled him.	163
Mark	And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.	164
Mark	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?	165
Mark	which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?	166
Mark	And some of them that stood by, when they heard [it], said, Behold, he calleth Elias.	167
Mark	And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put [it] on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.	168
Mark	And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.	169
Mark	And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.	170
Mark	And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.	171
Mark	There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;	172
Mark	(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.	173
Mark	And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,	174
Mark	Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counseller, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.	175
Mark	And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling [unto him] the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.	176
Mark	And when he knew [it] of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.	177
Mark	And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.	178
Mark	And Mary Magdalene and Mary [the mother] of Joses beheld where he was laid.	179
Mark	And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the [mother] of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.	180
Mark	And very early in the morning the first [day] of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.	181
Mark	And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?	182
Mark	And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.	183
Mark	And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.	184
Mark	And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.	185
Mark	But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.	186
Mark	And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any [man]; for they were afraid.	187
Mark	Now when [Jesus] was risen early the first [day] of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.	188
Mark	[And] she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.	189
Mark	And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.	190
Mark	After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.	191
Mark	And they went and told [it] unto the residue: neither believed they them.	192
Mark	Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.	193
Mark	And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.	194
Mark	He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.	195
Mark	And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;	196
Mark	They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.	197
Mark	So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.	198
Mark	And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with [them], and confirming the word with signs following.	199
Mark	Amen.	200
Luke	And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.	201
Luke	And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?	202
Luke	And I answered, Who art thou, Lord?	203
Luke	And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.	204
Luke	And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.	205
Luke	And I said, What shall I do, Lord?	206
Luke	And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.	207
Luke	And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.	208
Luke	And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt [there],	209
Luke	Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight.	210
Luke	And the same hour I looked up upon him.	211
Luke	And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.	212
Luke	For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.	213
Luke	And now why tarriest thou?	214
Luke	arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.	215
Luke	And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;	216
Luke	And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.	217
Luke	And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:	218
Luke	And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.	219
Luke	And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.	220
Luke	And they gave him audience unto this word, and [then] lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a [fellow] from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.	221
Luke	And as they cried out, and cast off [their] clothes, and threw dust into the air,	222
Luke	The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.	223
Luke	And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?	224
Luke	When the centurion heard [that], he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.	225
Luke	Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman?	226
Luke	He said, Yea.	227
Luke	And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom.	228
Luke	And Paul said, But I was [free] born.	229
Luke	Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.	230
Luke	On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from [his] bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.	231
Luke	And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men [and] brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.	232
Luke	And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.	233
Luke	Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, [thou] whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?	234
Luke	And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God’s high priest?	235
Luke	Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.	236
Luke	But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men [and] brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.	237
Luke	And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.	238
Luke	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.	239
Luke	And there arose a great cry: and the scribes [that were] of the Pharisees’ part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.	240
Luke	And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring [him] into the castle.	241
Luke	And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.	242
Luke	And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.	243
Luke	And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.	244
Luke	And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.	245
Luke	Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.	246
Luke	And when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.	247
Luke	Then Paul called one of the centurions unto [him], and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.	248
Luke	So he took him, and brought [him] to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto [him], and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.	249
Luke	Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went [with him] aside privately, and asked [him], What is that thou hast to tell me?	250
Luke	And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly.	251
Luke	But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.	252
Luke	So the chief captain [then] let the young man depart, and charged [him, See thou] tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.	253
Luke	And he called unto [him] two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;	254
Luke	And provide [them] beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring [him] safe unto Felix the governor.	255
Luke	And he wrote a letter after this manner:	256
Luke	Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix [sendeth] greeting.	257
Luke	This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.	258
Luke	And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:	259
Luke	Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.	260
Luke	And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what [they had] against him.	261
Luke	Farewell.	262
Luke	Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought [him] by night to Antipatris.	263
Luke	On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:	264
Luke	Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.	265
Luke	And when the governor had read [the letter], he asked of what province he was.	266
Luke	And when he understood that [he was] of Cilicia;	267
Luke	I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come.	268
Luke	And he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s judgment hall.	269
Luke	And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and [with] a certain orator [named] Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.	270
Luke	And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse [him], saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,	271
Luke	We accept [it] always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.	272
Luke	Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.	273
Luke	For we have found this man [a] pestilent [fellow], and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:	274
Luke	Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.	275
Luke	But the chief captain Lysias came [upon us], and with great violence took [him] away out of our hands,	276
Luke	Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.	277
Luke	And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.	278
Luke	Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:	279
Luke	Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.	280
Luke	And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:	281
Luke	Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.	282
Luke	But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:	283
Luke	And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.	284
Luke	And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and [toward] men.	285
Luke	Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.	286
Luke	Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.	287
Luke	Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.	288
Luke	Or else let these same [here] say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,	289
Luke	Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.	290
Luke	And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of [that] way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.	291
Luke	And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let [him] have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.	292
Luke	And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.	293
Luke	And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.	294
Luke	He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.	295
Luke	But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix’ room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.	296
Luke	Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.	297
Luke	Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,	298
Luke	And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.	299
Luke	But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly [thither].	300
Luke	Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with [me], and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.	301
Luke	And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.	302
Luke	And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.	303
Luke	While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.	304
Luke	But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?	305
Luke	Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.	306
Luke	For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them.	307
Luke	I appeal unto Caesar.	308
Luke	Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar?	309
Luke	unto Caesar shalt thou go.	310
Luke	And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.	311
Luke	And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:	312
Luke	About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed [me], desiring [to have] judgment against him.	313
Luke	To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.	314
Luke	Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.	315
Luke	Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:	316
Luke	But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.	317
Luke	And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked [him] whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.	318
Luke	But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.	319
Luke	Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself.	320
Luke	To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.	321
Luke	And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus’ commandment Paul was brought forth.	322
Luke	And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and [also] here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.	323
Luke	But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.	324
Luke	Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord.	325
Luke	Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.	326
Luke	For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes [laid] against him.	327
Luke	Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself.	328
Luke	Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:	329
Luke	I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:	330
Luke	Especially [because I know] thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.	331
Luke	My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;	332
Luke	Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.	333
Luke	And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:	334
Luke	Unto which [promise] our twelve tribes, instantly serving [God] day and night, hope to come.	335
Luke	For which hope’s sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.	336
Luke	Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?	337
Luke	I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.	338
Luke	Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against [them].	339
Luke	And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled [them] to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted [them] even unto strange cities.	340
Luke	Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,	341
Luke	At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.	342
Luke	And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?	343
Luke	[it is] hard for thee to kick against the pricks.	344
Luke	And I said, Who art thou, Lord?	345
Luke	And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.	346
Luke	But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;	347
Luke	Delivering thee from the people, and [from] the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,	348
Luke	To open their eyes, [and] to turn [them] from darkness to light, and [from] the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.	349
Luke	Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:	350
Luke	But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and [then] to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.	351
Luke	For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill [me].	352
Luke	Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:	353
Luke	That Christ should suffer, [and] that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.	354
Luke	And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.	355
Luke	But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.	356
Luke	For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.	357
Luke	King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets?	358
Luke	I know that thou believest.	359
Luke	Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.	360
Luke	And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.	361
Luke	And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:	362
Luke	And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.	363
Luke	Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.	364
Luke	And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto [one] named Julius, a centurion of Augustus’ band.	365
Luke	And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; [one] Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.	366
Luke	And the next [day] we touched at Sidon.	367
Luke	And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave [him] liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.	368
Luke	And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.	369
Luke	And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, [a city] of Lycia.	370
Luke	And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.	371
Luke	And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;	372
Luke	And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city [of] Lasea.	373
Luke	Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished [them],	374
Luke	And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.	375
Luke	Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.	376
Luke	And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, [and there] to winter; [which is] an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.	377
Luke	And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained [their] purpose, loosing [thence], they sailed close by Crete.	378
Luke	But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.	379
Luke	And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let [her] drive.	380
Luke	And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:	381
Luke	Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.	382
Luke	And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next [day] they lightened the ship;	383
Luke	And the third [day] we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.	384
Luke	And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on [us], all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.	385
Luke	But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.	386
Luke	And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of [any man’s] life among you, but of the ship.	387
Luke	For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,	388
Luke	Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.	389
Luke	Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.	390
Luke	Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.	391
Luke	But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;	392
Luke	And sounded, and found [it] twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found [it] fifteen fathoms.	393
Luke	Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.	394
Luke	And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,	395
Luke	Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.	396
Luke	Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.	397
Luke	And while the day was coming on, Paul besought [them] all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.	398
Luke	Wherefore I pray you to take [some] meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.	399
Luke	And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken [it], he began to eat.	400
Luke	Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took [some] meat.	401
Luke	And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.	402
Luke	And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.	403
Luke	And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.	404
Luke	And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed [themselves] unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.	405
Luke	And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.	406
Luke	And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.	407
Luke	But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from [their] purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast [themselves] first [into the sea], and get to land:	408
Luke	And the rest, some on boards, and some on [broken pieces] of the ship.	409
Luke	And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.	410
Luke	And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.	411
Luke	And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.	412
Luke	And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid [them] on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.	413
Luke	And when the barbarians saw the [venomous] beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.	414
Luke	And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.	415
Luke	Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.	416
Luke	In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.	417
Luke	And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.	418
Luke	So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:	419
Luke	Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded [us] with such things as were necessary.	420
Luke	And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.	421
Luke	And landing at Syracuse, we tarried [there] three days.	422
Luke	And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:	423
Luke	Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.	424
Luke	And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.	425
Luke	And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.	426
Luke	And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men [and] brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.	427
Luke	Who, when they had examined me, would have let [me] go, because there was no cause of death in me.	428
Luke	But when the Jews spake against [it], I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.	429
Luke	For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see [you], and to speak with [you]: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.	430
Luke	And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.	431
Luke	But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.	432
Luke	And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into [his] lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and [out of] the prophets, from morning till evening.	433
Luke	And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.	434
Luke	And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,	435
Luke	Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:	436
Luke	For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with [their] eyes, and hear with [their] ears, and understand with [their] heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.	437
Luke	Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and [that] they will hear it.	438
Luke	And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.	439
Luke	And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,	440
Luke	Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.	441
John	And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.	442
John	And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.	443
John	And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs [come] out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.	444
John	For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, [which] go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.	445
John	Behold, I come as a thief.	446
John	Blessed [is] he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.	447
John	And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.	448
John	And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.	449
John	And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, [and] so great.	450
John	And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.	451
John	And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.	452
John	And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, [every stone] about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.	453
John	And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:	454
John	With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.	455
John	So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.	456
John	And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:	457
John	And upon her forehead [was] a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.	458
John	And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.	459
John	And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel?	460
John	I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.	461
John	The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.	462
John	And here [is] the mind which hath wisdom.	463
John	The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.	464
John	And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, [and] the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.	465
John	And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.	466
John	And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.	467
John	These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.	468
John	These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him [are] called, and chosen, and faithful.	469
John	And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.	470
John	And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.	471
John	For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.	472
John	And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.	473
John	And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.	474
John	And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.	475
John	For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.	476
John	And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.	477
John	For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.	478
John	Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.	479
John	How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.	480
John	Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong [is] the Lord God who judgeth her.	481
John	And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,	482
John	Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city!	483
John	for in one hour is thy judgment come.	484
John	And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:	485
John	The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,	486
John	And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.	487
John	And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.	488
John	The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,	489
John	And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!	490
John	For in one hour so great riches is come to nought.	491
John	And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,	492
John	And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What [city is] like unto this great city!	493
John	And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness!	494
John	for in one hour is she made desolate.	495
John	Rejoice over her, [thou] heaven, and [ye] holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.	496
John	And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast [it] into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.	497
John	And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft [he be], shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;	498
John	And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.	499
John	And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.	500
John	And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:	501
John	For true and righteous [are] his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.	502
John	And again they said, Alleluia.	503
John	And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.	504
John	And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.	505
John	And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.	506
John	And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.	507
John	Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.	508
John	And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.	509
John	And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed [are] they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.	510
John	And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.	511
John	And I fell at his feet to worship him.	512
John	And he said unto me, See [thou do it] not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.	513
John	And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him [was] called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.	514
John	His eyes [were] as a flame of fire, and on his head [were] many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.	515
John	And he [was] clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.	516
John	And the armies [which were] in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.	517
John	And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.	518
John	And he hath on [his] vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.	519
John	And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;	520
John	That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all [men, both] free and bond, both small and great.	521
John	And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.	522
John	And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image.	523
John	These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.	524
John	And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which [sword] proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.	525
John	And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.	526
John	And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,	527
John	And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.	528
John	And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and [I saw] the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received [his] mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.	529
John	But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.	530
John	This [is] the first resurrection.	531
John	Blessed and holy [is] he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.	532
John	And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,	533
John	And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom [is] as the sand of the sea.	534
John	And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.	535
John	And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [are], and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.	536
John	And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.	537
John	And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is [the book] of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.	538
John	And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.	539
John	And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire.	540
John	This is the second death.	541
John	And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.	542
John	And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.	543
John	And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.	544
John	And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God [is] with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, [and be] their God.	545
John	And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.	546
John	And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.	547
John	And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.	548
John	And he said unto me, It is done.	549
John	I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.	550
John	I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.	551
John	He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.	552
John	But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.	553
John	And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife.	554
John	And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,	555
John	Having the glory of God: and her light [was] like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;	556
John	And had a wall great and high, [and] had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are [the names] of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:	557
John	On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.	558
John	And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.	559
John	And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.	560
John	And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs.	561
John	The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.	562
John	And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred [and] forty [and] four cubits, [according to] the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.	563
John	And the building of the wall of it was [of] jasper: and the city [was] pure gold, like unto clear glass.	564
John	And the foundations of the wall of the city [were] garnished with all manner of precious stones.	565
John	The first foundation [was] jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;	566
John	The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.	567
John	And the twelve gates [were] twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city [was] pure gold, as it were transparent glass.	568
John	And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.	569
John	And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb [is] the light thereof.	570
John	And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.	571
John	And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.	572
John	And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.	573
John	And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither [whatsoever] worketh abomination, or [maketh] a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.	574
John	And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.	575
John	In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, [was there] the tree of life, which bare twelve [manner of] fruits, [and] yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree [were] for the healing of the nations.	576
John	And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:	577
John	And they shall see his face; and his name [shall be] in their foreheads.	578
John	And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.	579
John	And he said unto me, These sayings [are] faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.	580
John	Behold, I come quickly: blessed [is] he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.	581
John	And I John saw these things, and heard [them].	582
John	And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things.	583
John	Then saith he unto me, See [thou do it] not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.	584
John	And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.	585
John	He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.	586
John	And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward [is] with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.	587
John	I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.	588
John	Blessed [are] they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.	589
John	For without [are] dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.	590
John	I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches.	591
John	I am the root and the offspring of David, [and] the bright and morning star.	592
John	And the Spirit and the bride say, Come.	593
John	And let him that heareth say, Come.	594
John	And let him that is athirst come.	595
John	And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.	596
John	For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:	597
John	And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and [from] the things which are written in this book.	598
John	He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly.	599
John	Amen.	600
John	Even so, come, Lord Jesus.	601
John	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all.	602
John	Amen.	603
Paul	But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.	604
Paul	Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.	605
Paul	For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.	606
Paul	For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.	607
Paul	I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.	608
Paul	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:	609
Paul	Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.	610
Paul	Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord.	611
Paul	To write the same things to you, to me indeed [is] not grievous, but for you [it is] safe.	612
Paul	Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.	613
Paul	For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.	614
Paul	Though I might also have confidence in the flesh.	615
Paul	If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:	616
Paul	Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, [of] the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;	617
Paul	Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.	618
Paul	But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.	619
Paul	Yea doubtless, and I count all things [but] loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them [but] dung, that I may win Christ,	620
Paul	And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:	621
Paul	That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;	622
Paul	If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.	623
Paul	Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.	624
Paul	Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but [this] one thing [I do], forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,	625
Paul	I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.	626
Paul	Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.	627
Paul	Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.	628
Paul	Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.	629
Paul	(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, [that they are] the enemies of the cross of Christ:	630
Paul	Whose end [is] destruction, whose God [is their] belly, and [whose] glory [is] in their shame, who mind earthly things.)	631
Paul	For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:	632
Paul	Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.	633
Paul	Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, [my] dearly beloved.	634
Paul	I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.	635
Paul	And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and [with] other my fellowlabourers, whose names [are] in the book of life.	636
Paul	Rejoice in the Lord alway: [and] again I say, Rejoice.	637
Paul	Let your moderation be known unto all men.	638
Paul	The Lord [is] at hand.	639
Paul	Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.	640
Paul	And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.	641
Paul	Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things [are] honest, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] lovely, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue, and if [there be] any praise, think on these things.	642
Paul	Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.	643
Paul	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.	644
Paul	Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, [therewith] to be content.	645
Paul	I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.	646
Paul	I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.	647
Paul	Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.	648
Paul	Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.	649
Paul	For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.	650
Paul	Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.	651
Paul	But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things [which were sent] from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.	652
Paul	But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.	653
Paul	Now unto God and our Father [be] glory for ever and ever.	654
Paul	Amen.	655
Paul	Salute every saint in Christ Jesus.	656
Paul	The brethren which are with me greet you.	657
Paul	All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar’s household.	658
Paul	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all.	659
Paul	Amen.	660
Paul	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians [which is] in God the Father and [in] the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.	661
Paul	We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;	662
Paul	Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;	663
Paul	Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.	664
Paul	For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.	665
Paul	And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:	666
Paul	So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.	667
Paul	For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.	668
Paul	For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;	669
Paul	And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, [even] Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.	670
Paul	For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:	671
Paul	But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.	672
Paul	For our exhortation [was] not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:	673
Paul	But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.	674
Paul	For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God [is] witness:	675
Paul	Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor [yet] of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.	676
Paul	But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:	677
Paul	So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.	678
Paul	For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.	679
Paul	Ye [are] witnesses, and God [also], how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:	680
Paul	As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father [doth] his children,	681
Paul	That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.	682
Paul	For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received [it] not [as] the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.	683
Paul	For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they [have] of the Jews:	684
Paul	Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:	685
Paul	Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.	686
Paul	But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.	687
Paul	Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.	688
Paul	For what [is] our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing?	689
Paul	[Are] not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?	690
Paul	For ye are our glory and joy.	691
Paul	Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;	692
Paul	And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:	693
Paul	That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.	694
Paul	For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.	695
Paul	For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.	696
Paul	But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also [to see] you:	697
Paul	Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:	698
Paul	For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.	699
Paul	For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;	700
Paul	Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?	701
Paul	Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.	702
Paul	And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all [men], even as we [do] toward you:	703
Paul	To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.	704
Paul	Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort [you] by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, [so] ye would abound more and more.	705
Paul	For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.	706
Paul	For this is the will of God, [even] your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:	707
Paul	That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;	708
Paul	Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:	709
Paul	That no [man] go beyond and defraud his brother in [any] matter: because that the Lord [is] the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.	710
Paul	For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.	711
Paul	He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.	712
Paul	But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.	713
Paul	And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;	714
Paul	And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;	715
Paul	That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and [that] ye may have lack of nothing.	716
Paul	But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.	717
Paul	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.	718
Paul	For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive [and] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.	719
Paul	For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:	720
Paul	Then we which are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.	721
Paul	Wherefore comfort one another with these words.	722
Paul	But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.	723
Paul	For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.	724
Paul	For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.	725
Paul	But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.	726
Paul	Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.	727
Paul	Therefore let us not sleep, as [do] others; but let us watch and be sober.	728
Paul	For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.	729
Paul	But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.	730
Paul	For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,	731
Paul	Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.	732
Paul	Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.	733
Paul	And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;	734
Paul	And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake.	735
Paul	[And] be at peace among yourselves.	736
Paul	Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all [men].	737
Paul	See that none render evil for evil unto any [man]; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all [men].	738
Paul	Rejoice evermore.	739
Paul	Pray without ceasing.	740
Paul	In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.	741
Paul	Quench not the Spirit.	742
Paul	Despise not prophesyings.	743
Paul	Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.	744
Paul	Abstain from all appearance of evil.	745
Paul	And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and [I pray God] your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.	746
Paul	Faithful [is] he that calleth you, who also will do [it].	747
Paul	Brethren, pray for us.	748
Paul	Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.	749
Paul	I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.	750
Paul	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you.	751
Paul	Amen.	752
Paul	Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy [our] brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,	753
Paul	And to [our] beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:	754
Paul	Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	755
Paul	I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,	756
Paul	Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;	757
Paul	That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.	758
Paul	For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.	759
Paul	Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,	760
Paul	Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech [thee], being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.	761
Paul	I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:	762
Paul	Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:	763
Paul	Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:	764
Paul	Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:	765
Paul	But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.	766
Paul	For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;	767
Paul	Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?	768
Paul	If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.	769
Paul	If he hath wronged thee, or oweth [thee] ought, put that on mine account;	770
Paul	I Paul have written [it] with mine own hand, I will repay [it]: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.	771
Paul	Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.	772
Paul	Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.	773
Paul	But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.	774
Paul	There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;	775
Paul	Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.	776
Paul	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit.	777
Paul	Amen.	778
Peter	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:	779
Peter	Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.	780
Peter	Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:	781
Peter	Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.	782
Peter	But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle [you].	783
Peter	To him [be] glory and dominion for ever and ever.	784
Peter	Amen.	785
Peter	By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.	786
Peter	The [church that is] at Babylon, elected together with [you], saluteth you; and [so doth] Marcus my son.	787
Peter	Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity.	788
Peter	Peace [be] with you all that are in Christ Jesus.	789
Peter	Amen.	790
James	But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and [your] nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.	791
James	Is any among you afflicted?	792
James	let him pray.	793
James	Is any merry?	794
James	let him sing psalms.	795
James	Is any sick among you?	796
James	let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:	797
James	And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.	798
James	Confess [your] faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed.	799
James	The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.	800
James	Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.	801
James	And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.	802
James	Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;	803
James	Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.	804
Jude	Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present [you] faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,	805
Jude	To the only wise God our Saviour, [be] glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever.	806
Jude	Amen.	807
