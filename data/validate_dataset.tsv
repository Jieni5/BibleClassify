Paul	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before [them] all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?	4764
Paul	We [who are] Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,	4765
Paul	Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.	4766
Paul	But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, [is] therefore Christ the minister of sin?	4767
Paul	God forbid.	4768
Paul	For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.	4769
Paul	For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.	4770
Paul	I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.	4771
Paul	I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness [come] by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.	4772
Paul	O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?	4773
Paul	This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?	4774
Paul	Are ye so foolish?	4775
Paul	having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?	4776
Paul	Have ye suffered so many things in vain?	4777
Paul	if [it be] yet in vain.	4778
Paul	He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, [doeth he it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?	4779
Paul	Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.	4780
Paul	Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.	4781
Paul	And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, [saying], In thee shall all nations be blessed.	4782
Paul	So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.	4783
Paul	For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.	4784
Paul	But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, [it is] evident: for, The just shall live by faith.	4785
Paul	And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.	4786
Paul	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that hangeth on a tree:	4787
Paul	That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.	4788
Paul	Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though [it be] but a man’s covenant, yet [if it be] confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.	4789
Paul	Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made.	4790
Paul	He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.	4791
Paul	And this I say, [that] the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.	4792
Paul	For if the inheritance [be] of the law, [it is] no more of promise: but God gave [it] to Abraham by promise.	4793
Paul	Wherefore then [serveth] the law?	4794
Paul	It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; [and it was] ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.	4795
Paul	Now a mediator is not [a mediator] of one, but God is one.	4796
Paul	[Is] the law then against the promises of God?	4797
Paul	God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.	4798
Paul	But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.	4799
Paul	But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.	4800
Paul	Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.	4801
Paul	But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.	4802
Paul	For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.	4803
Paul	For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.	4804
Paul	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.	4805
Paul	And if ye [be] Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.	4806
Paul	Now I say, [That] the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;	4807
Paul	But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.	4808
Paul	Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:	4809
Paul	But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,	4810
Paul	To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.	4811
Paul	And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.	4812
Paul	Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.	4813
Paul	Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.	4814
Paul	But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?	4815
Paul	Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.	4816
Paul	I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.	4817
Paul	Brethren, I beseech you, be as I [am]; for I [am] as ye [are]: ye have not injured me at all.	4818
Paul	Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.	4819
Paul	And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, [even] as Christ Jesus.	4820
Paul	Where is then the blessedness ye spake of?	4821
Paul	for I bear you record, that, if [it had been] possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.	4822
Paul	Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?	4823
Paul	They zealously affect you, [but] not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.	4824
Paul	But [it is] good to be zealously affected always in [a] good [thing], and not only when I am present with you.	4825
Paul	My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,	4826
Paul	I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.	4827
Paul	Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?	4828
Paul	For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.	4829
Paul	But he [who was] of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman [was] by promise.	4830
Paul	Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.	4831
Paul	For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.	4832
Paul	But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.	4833
Paul	For it is written, Rejoice, [thou] barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.	4834
Paul	Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.	4835
Paul	But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him [that was born] after the Spirit, even so [it is] now.	4836
Paul	Nevertheless what saith the scripture?	4837
Paul	Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.	4838
Paul	So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.	4839
Paul	Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.	4840
Paul	Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.	4841
Paul	For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.	4842
Paul	Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.	4843
Paul	For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.	4844
Paul	For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.	4845
Paul	Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?	4846
Paul	This persuasion [cometh] not of him that calleth you.	4847
Paul	A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.	4848
Paul	I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.	4849
Paul	And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution?	4850
Paul	then is the offence of the cross ceased.	4851
Paul	I would they were even cut off which trouble you.	4852
Paul	For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only [use] not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.	4853
Paul	For all the law is fulfilled in one word, [even] in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.	4854
Paul	But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.	4855
Paul	[This] I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.	4856
Paul	For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.	4857
Paul	But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.	4858
Paul	Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are [these]; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,	4859
Paul	Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,	4860
Paul	Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told [you] in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.	4861
Paul	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,	4862
Paul	Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.	4863
Paul	And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.	4864
Paul	If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.	4865
Paul	Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.	4866
Paul	Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.	4867
Paul	Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.	4868
Paul	For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.	4869
Paul	But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.	4870
Paul	For every man shall bear his own burden.	4871
Paul	Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.	4872
Paul	Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.	4873
Paul	For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.	4874
Paul	And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.	4875
Paul	As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all [men], especially unto them who are of the household of faith.	4876
Paul	Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.	4877
Paul	As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.	4878
Paul	For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.	4879
Paul	But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.	4880
Paul	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.	4881
Paul	And as many as walk according to this rule, peace [be] on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.	4882
Paul	From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.	4883
Paul	Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit.	4884
Paul	Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:	4885
Paul	Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.	4886
Paul	I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,	4887
Paul	Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,	4888
Paul	For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;	4889
Paul	Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform [it] until the day of Jesus Christ:	4890
Paul	Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.	4891
Paul	For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.	4892
Paul	And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and [in] all judgment;	4893
Paul	That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;	4894
Paul	Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.	4895
Paul	But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things [which happened] unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;	4896
Paul	So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other [places];	4897
Paul	And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.	4898
Paul	Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:	4899
Paul	The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:	4900
Paul	But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.	4901
Paul	What then?	4902
Paul	notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.	4903
Paul	For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,	4904
Paul	According to my earnest expectation and [my] hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether [it be] by life, or by death.	4905
Paul	For to me to live [is] Christ, and to die [is] gain.	4906
Paul	But if I live in the flesh, this [is] the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.	4907
Paul	For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:	4908
Paul	Nevertheless to abide in the flesh [is] more needful for you.	4909
Paul	And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;	4910
Paul	That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.	4911
Paul	Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;	4912
Paul	And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.	4913
Paul	For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;	4914
Paul	Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear [to be] in me.	4915
Paul	If [there be] therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,	4916
Paul	Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, [being] of one accord, of one mind.	4917
Paul	[Let] nothing [be done] through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.	4918
Paul	Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.	4919
Paul	Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:	4920
Paul	Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:	4921
Paul	But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:	4922
Paul	And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.	4923
Paul	Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:	4924
Paul	That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of [things] in heaven, and [things] in earth, and [things] under the earth;	4925
Paul	And [that] every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord, to the glory of God the Father.	4926
Paul	Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.	4927
Paul	For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of [his] good pleasure.	4928
Paul	Do all things without murmurings and disputings:	4929
Paul	That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;	4930
Paul	Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.	4931
Paul	Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.	4932
Paul	For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.	4933
Paul	But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.	4934
Paul	For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.	4935
Paul	For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s.	4936
Peter	But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.	4937
Peter	But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.	4938
