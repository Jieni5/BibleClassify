Matthew	The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
Matthew	Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;
Matthew	And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;
Matthew	And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;
Matthew	And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;
Matthew	And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her [that had been the wife] of Urias;
Matthew	And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;
Matthew	And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;
Matthew	And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;
Matthew	And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;
Matthew	And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:
Matthew	And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;
Matthew	And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
Matthew	And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;
Matthew	And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;
Matthew	And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
Matthew	So all the generations from Abraham to David [are] fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon [are] fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ [are] fourteen generations.
Matthew	Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.
Matthew	Then Joseph her husband, being a just [man], and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.
Matthew	But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.
Matthew	And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.
Matthew	Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
Matthew	Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
Matthew	Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:
Matthew	And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.
Matthew	Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,
Matthew	Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews?
Matthew	for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.
Matthew	When Herod the king had heard [these things], he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
Matthew	And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.
Matthew	And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,
Matthew	And thou Bethlehem, [in] the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.
Matthew	Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.
Matthew	And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found [him], bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.
Matthew	When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
Matthew	When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
Matthew	And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
Matthew	And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.
Matthew	And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.
Matthew	When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:
Matthew	And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.
Matthew	Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.
Matthew	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,
Matthew	In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping [for] her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.
Matthew	But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
Matthew	Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child’s life.
Matthew	And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
Matthew	But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:
Matthew	And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.
Matthew	In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,
Matthew	And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Matthew	For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
Matthew	And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.
Matthew	Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,
Matthew	And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.
Matthew	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Matthew	Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:
Matthew	And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to [our] father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
Matthew	And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
Matthew	I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and [with] fire:
Matthew	Whose fan [is] in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
Matthew	Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.
Matthew	But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?
Matthew	And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer [it to be so] now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.
Matthew	Then he suffered him.
Matthew	And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:
Matthew	And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
Matthew	Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.
Matthew	And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.
Matthew	And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.
Matthew	But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
Matthew	Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,
Matthew	And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in [their] hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Matthew	Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
Matthew	Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;
Matthew	And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
Matthew	Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
Matthew	Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.
Matthew	Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;
Matthew	And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:
Matthew	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,
Matthew	The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, [by] the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;
Matthew	The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.
Matthew	From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Matthew	And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
Matthew	And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.
Matthew	And they straightway left [their] nets, and followed him.
Matthew	And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James [the son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.
Matthew	And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.
Matthew	And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.
Matthew	And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.
Matthew	And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and [from] Decapolis, and [from] Jerusalem, and [from] Judaea, and [from] beyond Jordan.
Matthew	And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:
Matthew	And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
Matthew	Blessed [are] the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew	Blessed [are] they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
Matthew	Blessed [are] the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
Matthew	Blessed [are] they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
Matthew	Blessed [are] the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
Matthew	Blessed [are] the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
Matthew	Blessed [are] the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
Matthew	Blessed [are] they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew	Blessed are ye, when [men] shall revile you, and persecute [you], and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
Matthew	Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great [is] your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.
Matthew	Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted?
Matthew	it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.
Matthew	Ye are the light of the world.
Matthew	A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.
Matthew	Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.
Matthew	Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
Matthew	Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.
Matthew	For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.
Matthew	Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach [them], the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew	For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed [the righteousness] of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew	Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:
Matthew	But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.
Matthew	Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;
Matthew	Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.
Matthew	Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.
Matthew	Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.
Matthew	Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:
Matthew	But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.
Matthew	And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast [it] from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not [that] thy whole body should be cast into hell.
Matthew	And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast [it] from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not [that] thy whole body should be cast into hell.
Matthew	It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:
Matthew	But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.
Matthew	Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:
Matthew	But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne:
Matthew	Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.
Matthew	Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.
Matthew	But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.
Matthew	Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:
Matthew	But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
Matthew	And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have [thy] cloke also.
Matthew	And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.
Matthew	Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.
Matthew	Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.
Matthew	But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;
Matthew	That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.
Matthew	For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye?
Matthew	do not even the publicans the same?
Matthew	And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more [than others]?
Matthew	do not even the publicans so?
Matthew	Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.
Matthew	Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.
Matthew	Therefore when thou doest [thine] alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men.
Matthew	Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
Matthew	But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:
Matthew	That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.
Matthew	And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites [are]: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.
Matthew	Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
Matthew	But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
Matthew	But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen [do]: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
Matthew	Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
Matthew	After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
Matthew	Thy kingdom come.
Matthew	Thy will be done in earth, as [it is] in heaven.
Matthew	Give us this day our daily bread.
Matthew	And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
Matthew	And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.
Matthew	Amen.
Matthew	For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:
Matthew	But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
Matthew	Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast.
Matthew	Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
Matthew	But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;
Matthew	That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.
Matthew	Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:
Matthew	But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:
Matthew	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
Matthew	The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.
Matthew	But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.
Matthew	If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great [is] that darkness!
Matthew	No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.
Matthew	Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
Matthew	Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on.
Matthew	Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
Matthew	Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.
Matthew	Are ye not much better than they?
Matthew	Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
Matthew	And why take ye thought for raiment?
Matthew	Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:
Matthew	And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
Matthew	Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, [shall he] not much more [clothe] you, O ye of little faith?
Matthew	Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat?
Matthew	or, What shall we drink?
Matthew	or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
Matthew	(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
Matthew	But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
Matthew	Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.
Matthew	Sufficient unto the day [is] the evil thereof.
Matthew	Judge not, that ye be not judged.
Matthew	For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.
Matthew	And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
Matthew	Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam [is] in thine own eye?
Matthew	Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.
Matthew	Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.
Matthew	Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:
Matthew	For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
Matthew	Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?
Matthew	Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
Matthew	If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
Matthew	Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.
Matthew	Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide [is] the gate, and broad [is] the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:
Matthew	Because strait [is] the gate, and narrow [is] the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.
Matthew	Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
Matthew	Ye shall know them by their fruits.
Matthew	Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
Matthew	Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
Matthew	A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither [can] a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
Matthew	Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
Matthew	Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
Matthew	Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
Matthew	Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name?
Matthew	and in thy name have cast out devils?
Matthew	and in thy name done many wonderful works?
Matthew	And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
Matthew	Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:
Matthew	And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.
Matthew	And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:
Matthew	And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.
Matthew	And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:
Matthew	For he taught them as [one] having authority, and not as the scribes.
Matthew	When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
Matthew	And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
Matthew	And Jesus put forth [his] hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean.
Matthew	And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
Matthew	And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
Matthew	And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,
Matthew	And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.
Matthew	And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.
Matthew	The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.
Matthew	For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this [man], Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth [it].
Matthew	When Jesus heard [it], he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
Matthew	And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew	But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew	And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, [so] be it done unto thee.
Matthew	And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.
Matthew	And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother laid, and sick of a fever.
Matthew	And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.
Matthew	When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with [his] word, and healed all that were sick:
Matthew	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare [our] sicknesses.
Matthew	Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.
Matthew	And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
Matthew	And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air [have] nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay [his] head.
Matthew	And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
Matthew	But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.
Matthew	And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.
Matthew	And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.
Matthew	And his disciples came to [him], and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.
Matthew	And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?
Matthew	Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.
Matthew	But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!
Matthew	And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.
Matthew	And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God?
Matthew	art thou come hither to torment us before the time?
Matthew	And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.
Matthew	So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.
Matthew	And he said unto them, Go.
Matthew	And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.
Matthew	And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.
Matthew	And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought [him] that he would depart out of their coasts.
Matthew	And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.
Matthew	And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.
Matthew	And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This [man] blasphemeth.
Matthew	And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?
Matthew	For whether is easier, to say, [Thy] sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?
Matthew	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.
Matthew	And he arose, and departed to his house.
Matthew	But when the multitudes saw [it], they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men.
Matthew	And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me.
Matthew	And he arose, and followed him.
Matthew	And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.
Matthew	And when the Pharisees saw [it], they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?
Matthew	But when Jesus heard [that], he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.
Matthew	But go ye and learn what [that] meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
Matthew	Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?
Matthew	And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them?
Matthew	but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.
Matthew	No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.
Matthew	Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.
Matthew	While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.
Matthew	And Jesus arose, and followed him, and [so did] his disciples.
Matthew	And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind [him], and touched the hem of his garment:
Matthew	For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.
Matthew	But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole.
Matthew	And the woman was made whole from that hour.
Matthew	And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,
Matthew	He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth.
Matthew	And they laughed him to scorn.
Matthew	But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.
Matthew	And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.
Matthew	And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, [Thou] Son of David, have mercy on us.
Matthew	And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this?
Matthew	They said unto him, Yea, Lord.
Matthew	Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.
Matthew	And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See [that] no man know [it].
Matthew	But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.
Matthew	As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.
Matthew	And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.
Matthew	But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.
Matthew	And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
Matthew	But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.
Matthew	Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly [is] plenteous, but the labourers [are] few;
Matthew	Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.
Matthew	And when he had called unto [him] his twelve disciples, he gave them power [against] unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.
Matthew	Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James [the son] of Zebedee, and John his brother;
Matthew	Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James [the son] of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;
Matthew	Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
Matthew	These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into [any] city of the Samaritans enter ye not:
Matthew	But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Matthew	And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Matthew	Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.
Matthew	Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,
Matthew	Nor scrip for [your] journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.
Matthew	And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.
Matthew	And when ye come into an house, salute it.
Matthew	And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.
Matthew	And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.
Matthew	Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.
Matthew	Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
Matthew	But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;
Matthew	And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.
Matthew	But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.
Matthew	For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.
Matthew	And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against [their] parents, and cause them to be put to death.
Matthew	And ye shall be hated of all [men] for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.
Matthew	But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.
Matthew	The disciple is not above [his] master, nor the servant above his lord.
Matthew	It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord.
Matthew	If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more [shall they call] them of his household?
Matthew	Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.
Matthew	What I tell you in darkness, [that] speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, [that] preach ye upon the housetops.
Matthew	And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
Matthew	Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing?
Matthew	and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.
Matthew	But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
Matthew	Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.
Matthew	Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.
Matthew	But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.
Matthew	Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.
Matthew	For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.
Matthew	And a man’s foes [shall be] they of his own household.
Matthew	He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
Matthew	And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.
Matthew	He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.
Matthew	He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
Matthew	He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.
Matthew	And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold [water] only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.
Matthew	And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.
Matthew	Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,
Matthew	And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?
Matthew	Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:
Matthew	The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
Matthew	And blessed is [he], whosoever shall not be offended in me.
Matthew	And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see?
Matthew	A reed shaken with the wind?
Matthew	But what went ye out for to see?
Matthew	A man clothed in soft raiment?
Matthew	behold, they that wear soft [clothing] are in kings’ houses.
Matthew	But what went ye out for to see?
Matthew	A prophet?
Matthew	yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.
Matthew	For this is [he], of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
Matthew	Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
Matthew	And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.
Matthew	For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
Matthew	And if ye will receive [it], this is Elias, which was for to come.
Matthew	He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Matthew	But whereunto shall I liken this generation?
Matthew	It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,
Matthew	And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.
Matthew	For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.
Matthew	The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.
Matthew	But wisdom is justified of her children.
Matthew	Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:
Matthew	Woe unto thee, Chorazin!
Matthew	woe unto thee, Bethsaida!
Matthew	for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
Matthew	But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.
Matthew	And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
Matthew	But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.
Matthew	At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.
Matthew	Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.
Matthew	All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and [he] to whomsoever the Son will reveal [him].
Matthew	Come unto me, all [ye] that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
Matthew	Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
Matthew	For my yoke [is] easy, and my burden is light.
Matthew	At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.
Matthew	But when the Pharisees saw [it], they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.
Matthew	But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;
Matthew	How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?
Matthew	Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?
Matthew	But I say unto you, That in this place is [one] greater than the temple.
Matthew	But if ye had known what [this] meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.
Matthew	For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.
Matthew	And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:
Matthew	And, behold, there was a man which had [his] hand withered.
Matthew	And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days?
Matthew	that they might accuse him.
Matthew	And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift [it] out?
Matthew	How much then is a man better than a sheep?
Matthew	Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.
Matthew	Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand.
Matthew	And he stretched [it] forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.
Matthew	Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.
Matthew	But when Jesus knew [it], he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;
Matthew	And charged them that they should not make him known:
Matthew	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,
Matthew	Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.
Matthew	He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.
Matthew	A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.
Matthew	And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
Matthew	Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.
Matthew	And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?
Matthew	But when the Pharisees heard [it], they said, This [fellow] doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.
Matthew	And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:
Matthew	And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?
Matthew	And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast [them] out?
Matthew	therefore they shall be your judges.
Matthew	But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.
Matthew	Or else how can one enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man?
Matthew	and then he will spoil his house.
Matthew	He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.
Matthew	Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy [against] the [Holy] Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.
Matthew	And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the [world] to come.
Matthew	Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by [his] fruit.
Matthew	O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things?
Matthew	for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
Matthew	A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.
Matthew	But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.
Matthew	For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
Matthew	Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.
Matthew	But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:
Matthew	For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
Matthew	The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas [is] here.
Matthew	The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon [is] here.
Matthew	When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.
Matthew	Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth [it] empty, swept, and garnished.
Matthew	Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last [state] of that man is worse than the first.
Matthew	Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.
Matthew	While he yet talked to the people, behold, [his] mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.
Matthew	Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.
Matthew	But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother?
Matthew	and who are my brethren?
Matthew	And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
Matthew	For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
Matthew	The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.
Matthew	And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.
Matthew	And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;
Matthew	And when he sowed, some [seeds] fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:
Matthew	Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:
Matthew	And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
Matthew	And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:
Matthew	But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.
Matthew	Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Matthew	And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?
Matthew	He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
Matthew	For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.
Matthew	Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.
Matthew	And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:
Matthew	For this people’s heart is waxed gross, and [their] ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with [their] eyes, and hear with [their] ears, and should understand with [their] heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
Matthew	But blessed [are] your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.
Matthew	For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous [men] have desired to see [those things] which ye see, and have not seen [them]; and to hear [those things] which ye hear, and have not heard [them].
Matthew	Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
Matthew	When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth [it] not, then cometh the wicked [one], and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart.
Matthew	This is he which received seed by the way side.
Matthew	But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;
Matthew	Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.
Matthew	He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.
Matthew	But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth [it]; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
Matthew	Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:
Matthew	But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.
Matthew	But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.
Matthew	So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field?
Matthew	from whence then hath it tares?
Matthew	He said unto them, An enemy hath done this.
Matthew	The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?
Matthew	But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.
Matthew	Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.
Matthew	Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:
Matthew	Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.
Matthew	Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
Matthew	All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:
Matthew	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.
Matthew	Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.
Matthew	He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;
Matthew	The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];
Matthew	The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
Matthew	As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
Matthew	The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;
Matthew	And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew	Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.
Matthew	Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Matthew	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
Matthew	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:
Matthew	Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
Matthew	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:
Matthew	Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.
Matthew	So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,
Matthew	And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew	Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things?
Matthew	They say unto him, Yea, Lord.
Matthew	Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe [which is] instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man [that is] an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure [things] new and old.
Matthew	And it came to pass, [that] when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.
Matthew	And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this [man] this wisdom, and [these] mighty works?
Matthew	Is not this the carpenter’s son?
Matthew	is not his mother called Mary?
Matthew	and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
Matthew	And his sisters, are they not all with us?
Matthew	Whence then hath this [man] all these things?
Matthew	And they were offended in him.
Matthew	But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.
Matthew	And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
Matthew	At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,
Matthew	And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.
Matthew	For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put [him] in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife.
Matthew	For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.
Matthew	And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
Matthew	But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.
Matthew	Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.
Matthew	And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist’s head in a charger.
Matthew	And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath’s sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded [it] to be given [her].
Matthew	And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.
Matthew	And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought [it] to her mother.
Matthew	And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.
Matthew	When Jesus heard [of it], he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard [thereof], they followed him on foot out of the cities.
Matthew	And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.
Matthew	And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.
Matthew	But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.
Matthew	And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.
Matthew	He said, Bring them hither to me.
Matthew	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to [his] disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
Matthew	And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.
Matthew	And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.
Matthew	And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
Matthew	And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.
Matthew	But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.
Matthew	And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.
Matthew	And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.
Matthew	But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
Matthew	And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.
Matthew	And he said, Come.
Matthew	And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.
Matthew	But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.
Matthew	And immediately Jesus stretched forth [his] hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
Matthew	And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.
Matthew	Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.
Matthew	And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.
Matthew	And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;
Matthew	And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.
Matthew	Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,
Matthew	Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?
Matthew	for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
Matthew	But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?
Matthew	For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.
Matthew	But ye say, Whosoever shall say to [his] father or [his] mother, [It is] a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;
Matthew	And honour not his father or his mother, [he shall be free].
Matthew	Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.
Matthew	[Ye] hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,
Matthew	This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with [their] lips; but their heart is far from me.
Matthew	But in vain they do worship me, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men.
Matthew	And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:
Matthew	Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.
Matthew	Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?
Matthew	But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.
Matthew	Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind.
Matthew	And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.
Matthew	Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.
Matthew	And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?
Matthew	Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?
Matthew	But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.
Matthew	For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:
Matthew	These are [the things] which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.
Matthew	Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.
Matthew	And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, [thou] Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.
Matthew	But he answered her not a word.
Matthew	And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.
Matthew	But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Matthew	Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
Matthew	But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast [it] to dogs.
Matthew	And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.
Matthew	Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great [is] thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt.
Matthew	And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.
Matthew	And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.
Matthew	And great multitudes came unto him, having with them [those that were] lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed them:
Matthew	Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.
Matthew	Then Jesus called his disciples [unto him], and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.
Matthew	And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?
Matthew	And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye?
Matthew	And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.
Matthew	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
Matthew	And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake [them], and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
Matthew	And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken [meat] that was left seven baskets full.
Matthew	And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.
Matthew	And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.
Matthew	The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.
Matthew	He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, [It will be] fair weather: for the sky is red.
Matthew	And in the morning, [It will be] foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring.
Matthew	O [ye] hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not [discern] the signs of the times?
Matthew	A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.
Matthew	And he left them, and departed.
Matthew	And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
Matthew	Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
Matthew	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, [It is] because we have taken no bread.
Matthew	[Which] when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?
Matthew	Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
Matthew	Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
Matthew	How is it that ye do not understand that I spake [it] not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?
Matthew	Then understood they how that he bade [them] not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
Matthew	When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?
Matthew	And they said, Some [say that thou art] John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.
Matthew	He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?
Matthew	And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
Matthew	And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed [it] unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.
Matthew	And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
Matthew	And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Matthew	Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.
Matthew	From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.
Matthew	Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.
Matthew	But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.
Matthew	Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any [man] will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
Matthew	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.
Matthew	For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
Matthew	or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
Matthew	For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.
Matthew	Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
Matthew	And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,
Matthew	And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.
Matthew	And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.
Matthew	Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
Matthew	While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.
Matthew	And when the disciples heard [it], they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.
Matthew	And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.
Matthew	And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.
Matthew	And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.
Matthew	And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?
Matthew	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.
Matthew	But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed.
Matthew	Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.
Matthew	Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.
Matthew	And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a [certain] man, kneeling down to him, and saying,
Matthew	Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.
Matthew	And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
Matthew	Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you?
Matthew	how long shall I suffer you?
Matthew	bring him hither to me.
Matthew	And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.
Matthew	Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?
Matthew	And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.
Matthew	Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.
Matthew	And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:
Matthew	And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again.
Matthew	And they were exceeding sorry.
Matthew	And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute [money] came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?
Matthew	He saith, Yes.
Matthew	And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon?
Matthew	of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute?
Matthew	of their own children, or of strangers?
Matthew	Peter saith unto him, Of strangers.
Matthew	Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free.
Matthew	Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.
Matthew	At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
Matthew	And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,
Matthew	And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew	Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew	And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.
Matthew	But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and [that] he were drowned in the depth of the sea.
Matthew	Woe unto the world because of offences!
Matthew	for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!
Matthew	Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast [them] from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.
Matthew	And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast [it] from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.
Matthew	Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.
Matthew	For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
Matthew	How think ye?
Matthew	if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?
Matthew	And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that [sheep], than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.
Matthew	Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.
Matthew	Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.
Matthew	But if he will not hear [thee, then] take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
Matthew	And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell [it] unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.
Matthew	Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Matthew	Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.
Matthew	For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
Matthew	Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?
Matthew	till seven times?
Matthew	Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.
Matthew	Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.
Matthew	And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.
Matthew	But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.
Matthew	The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
Matthew	Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.
Matthew	But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took [him] by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.
Matthew	And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
Matthew	And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.
Matthew	So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.
Matthew	Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:
Matthew	Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?
Matthew	And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.
Matthew	So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.
Matthew	And it came to pass, [that] when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;
Matthew	And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.
Matthew	The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
Matthew	And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made [them] at the beginning made them male and female,
Matthew	And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?
Matthew	Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh.
Matthew	What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
Matthew	They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?
Matthew	He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.
Matthew	And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except [it be] for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.
Matthew	His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with [his] wife, it is not good to marry.
Matthew	But he said unto them, All [men] cannot receive this saying, save [they] to whom it is given.
Matthew	For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from [their] mother’s womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake.
Matthew	He that is able to receive [it], let him receive [it].
Matthew	Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put [his] hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.
Matthew	But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew	And he laid [his] hands on them, and departed thence.
Matthew	And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?
Matthew	And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good?
Matthew	[there is] none good but one, [that is], God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
Matthew	He saith unto him, Which?
Matthew	Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
Matthew	Honour thy father and [thy] mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
Matthew	The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?
Matthew	Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go [and] sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come [and] follow me.
Matthew	But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.
Matthew	Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew	And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
Matthew	When his disciples heard [it], they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?
Matthew	But Jesus beheld [them], and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.
Matthew	Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?
Matthew	And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Matthew	And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.
Matthew	But many [that are] first shall be last; and the last [shall be] first.
Matthew	For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man [that is] an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.
Matthew	And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
Matthew	And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,
Matthew	And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you.
Matthew	And they went their way.
Matthew	Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.
Matthew	And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
Matthew	They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us.
Matthew	He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, [that] shall ye receive.
Matthew	So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them [their] hire, beginning from the last unto the first.
Matthew	And when they came that [were hired] about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.
Matthew	But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.
Matthew	And when they had received [it], they murmured against the goodman of the house,
Matthew	Saying, These last have wrought [but] one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.
Matthew	But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?
Matthew	Take [that] thine [is], and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.
Matthew	Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?
Matthew	Is thine eye evil, because I am good?
Matthew	So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.
Matthew	And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,
Matthew	Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,
Matthew	And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify [him]: and the third day he shall rise again.
Matthew	Then came to him the mother of Zebedee’s children with her sons, worshipping [him], and desiring a certain thing of him.
Matthew	And he said unto her, What wilt thou?
Matthew	She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.
Matthew	But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask.
Matthew	Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
Matthew	They say unto him, We are able.
Matthew	And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but [it shall be given to them] for whom it is prepared of my Father.
Matthew	And when the ten heard [it], they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.
Matthew	But Jesus called them [unto him], and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.
Matthew	But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;
Matthew	And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:
Matthew	Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
Matthew	And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
Matthew	And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, [thou] Son of David.
Matthew	And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, [thou] Son of David.
Matthew	And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?
Matthew	They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
Matthew	So Jesus had compassion [on them], and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.
Matthew	And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,
Matthew	Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose [them], and bring [them] unto me.
Matthew	And if any [man] say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.
Matthew	All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,
Matthew	Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.
Matthew	And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,
Matthew	And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set [him] thereon.
Matthew	And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed [them] in the way.
Matthew	And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed [is] he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.
Matthew	And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?
Matthew	And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.
Matthew	And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,
Matthew	And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.
Matthew	And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.
Matthew	And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; they were sore displeased,
Matthew	And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say?
Matthew	And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?
Matthew	And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.
Matthew	Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.
Matthew	And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever.
Matthew	And presently the fig tree withered away.
Matthew	And when the disciples saw [it], they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!
Matthew	Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this [which is done] to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.
Matthew	And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.
Matthew	And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things?
Matthew	and who gave thee this authority?
Matthew	And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.
Matthew	The baptism of John, whence was it?
Matthew	from heaven, or of men?
Matthew	And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?
Matthew	But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.
Matthew	And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell.
Matthew	And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
Matthew	But what think ye?
Matthew	A [certain] man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.
Matthew	He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.
Matthew	And he came to the second, and said likewise.
Matthew	And he answered and said, I [go], sir: and went not.
Matthew	Whether of them twain did the will of [his] father?
Matthew	They say unto him, The first.
Matthew	Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
Matthew	For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen [it], repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.
Matthew	Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:
Matthew	And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.
Matthew	And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
Matthew	Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.
Matthew	But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
Matthew	But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.
Matthew	And they caught him, and cast [him] out of the vineyard, and slew [him].
Matthew	When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?
Matthew	They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out [his] vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.
Matthew	Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
Matthew	Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.
Matthew	And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
Matthew	And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.
Matthew	But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.
Matthew	And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,
Matthew	The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,
Matthew	And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.
Matthew	Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and [my] fatlings [are] killed, and all things [are] ready: come unto the marriage.
Matthew	But they made light of [it], and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:
Matthew	And the remnant took his servants, and entreated [them] spitefully, and slew [them].
Matthew	But when the king heard [thereof], he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.
Matthew	Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.
Matthew	Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.
Matthew	So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.
Matthew	And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:
Matthew	And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment?
Matthew	And he was speechless.
Matthew	Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast [him] into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew	For many are called, but few [are] chosen.
Matthew	Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in [his] talk.
Matthew	And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any [man]: for thou regardest not the person of men.
Matthew	Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou?
Matthew	Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?
Matthew	But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, [ye] hypocrites?
Matthew	Shew me the tribute money.
Matthew	And they brought unto him a penny.
Matthew	And he saith unto them, Whose [is] this image and superscription?
Matthew	They say unto him, Caesar’s.
Matthew	Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.
Matthew	When they had heard [these words], they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.
Matthew	The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,
Matthew	Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
Matthew	Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:
Matthew	Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.
Matthew	And last of all the woman died also.
Matthew	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven?
Matthew	for they all had her.
Matthew	Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.
Matthew	For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
Matthew	But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,
Matthew	I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
Matthew	God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
Matthew	And when the multitude heard [this], they were astonished at his doctrine.
Matthew	But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.
Matthew	Then one of them, [which was] a lawyer, asked [him a question], tempting him, and saying,
Matthew	Master, which [is] the great commandment in the law?
Matthew	Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
Matthew	This is the first and great commandment.
Matthew	And the second [is] like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
Matthew	On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
Matthew	While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
Matthew	Saying, What think ye of Christ?
Matthew	whose son is he?
Matthew	They say unto him, [The Son] of David.
Matthew	He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,
Matthew	The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?
Matthew	If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?
Matthew	And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any [man] from that day forth ask him any more [questions].
Matthew	Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,
Matthew	Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat:
Matthew	All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, [that] observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.
Matthew	For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay [them] on men’s shoulders; but they [themselves] will not move them with one of their fingers.
Matthew	But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,
Matthew	And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
Matthew	And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.
Matthew	But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, [even] Christ; and all ye are brethren.
Matthew	And call no [man] your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.
Matthew	Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, [even] Christ.
Matthew	But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
Matthew	And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.
Matthew	But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
Matthew	for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in [yourselves], neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.
Matthew	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
Matthew	for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.
Matthew	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
Matthew	for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.
Matthew	Woe unto you, [ye] blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!
Matthew	[Ye] fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?
Matthew	And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.
Matthew	[Ye] fools and blind: for whether [is] greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?
Matthew	Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.
Matthew	And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.
Matthew	And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.
Matthew	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
Matthew	for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier [matters] of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
Matthew	[Ye] blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.
Matthew	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
Matthew	for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.
Matthew	[Thou] blind Pharisee, cleanse first that [which is] within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.
Matthew	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
Matthew	for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead [men’s] bones, and of all uncleanness.
Matthew	Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
Matthew	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
Matthew	because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,
Matthew	And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
Matthew	Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.
Matthew	Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.
Matthew	[Ye] serpents, [ye] generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?
Matthew	Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and [some] of them ye shall kill and crucify; and [some] of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute [them] from city to city:
Matthew	That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.
Matthew	Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.
Matthew	O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, [thou] that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under [her] wings, and ye would not!
Matthew	Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.
Matthew	For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed [is] he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
Matthew	And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to [him] for to shew him the buildings of the temple.
Matthew	And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things?
Matthew	verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
Matthew	And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be?
Matthew	and what [shall be] the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?
Matthew	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
Matthew	For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
Matthew	And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all [these things] must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
Matthew	For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
Matthew	All these [are] the beginning of sorrows.
Matthew	Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.
Matthew	And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
Matthew	And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
Matthew	And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
Matthew	But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
Matthew	And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.
Matthew	When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)
Matthew	Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:
Matthew	Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:
Matthew	Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.
Matthew	And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!
Matthew	But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:
Matthew	For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.
Matthew	And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.
Matthew	Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here [is] Christ, or there; believe [it] not.
Matthew	For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if [it were] possible, they shall deceive the very elect.
Matthew	Behold, I have told you before.
Matthew	Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, [he is] in the secret chambers; believe [it] not.
Matthew	For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
Matthew	For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.
Matthew	Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:
Matthew	And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
Matthew	And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
Matthew	Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer [is] nigh:
Matthew	So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, [even] at the doors.
Matthew	Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.
Matthew	Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
Matthew	But of that day and hour knoweth no [man], no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.
Matthew	But as the days of Noe [were], so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
Matthew	For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,
Matthew	And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
Matthew	Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
Matthew	Two [women shall be] grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
Matthew	Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.
Matthew	But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.
Matthew	Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.
Mark	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
Mark	As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
Mark	The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
Mark	John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
Mark	And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.
Mark	And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;
Mark	And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.
Mark	I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
Mark	And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.
Mark	And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:
Mark	And there came a voice from heaven, [saying], Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
Mark	And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.
Mark	And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.
Mark	Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
Mark	And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.
Mark	Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
Mark	And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.
Mark	And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.
Mark	And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.
Mark	And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.
Mark	And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.
Mark	And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.
Mark	And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
Mark	Saying, Let [us] alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth?
Mark	art thou come to destroy us?
Mark	I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
Mark	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.
Mark	And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.
Mark	And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this?
Mark	what new doctrine [is] this?
Mark	for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.
Mark	And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.
Mark	And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
Mark	But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.
Mark	And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.
Mark	And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.
Mark	And all the city was gathered together at the door.
Mark	And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.
Mark	And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.
Mark	And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.
Mark	And when they had found him, they said unto him, All [men] seek for thee.
Mark	And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.
Mark	And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.
Mark	And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
Mark	And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth [his] hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.
Mark	And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.
Mark	And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;
Mark	And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
Mark	But he went out, and began to publish [it] much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
Mark	And again he entered into Capernaum, after [some] days; and it was noised that he was in the house.
Mark	And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive [them], no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.
Mark	And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.
Mark	And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken [it] up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.
Mark	When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.
Mark	But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
Mark	Why doth this [man] thus speak blasphemies?
Mark	who can forgive sins but God only?
Mark	And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?
Mark	Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, [Thy] sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?
Mark	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)
Mark	I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.
Mark	And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.
Mark	And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.
Mark	And as he passed by, he saw Levi the [son] of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me.
Mark	And he arose and followed him.
Mark	And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.
Mark	And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?
Mark	When Jesus heard [it], he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
Mark	And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
Mark	And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?
Mark	as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
Mark	But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.
Mark	No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.
Mark	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.
Mark	And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.
Mark	And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?
Mark	And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?
Mark	How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?
Mark	And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:
Mark	Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
Mark	And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.
Mark	And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.
Mark	And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.
Mark	And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil?
Mark	to save life, or to kill?
Mark	But they held their peace.
Mark	And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand.
Mark	And he stretched [it] out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
Mark	And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
Mark	But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,
Mark	And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and [from] beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.
Mark	And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.
Mark	For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.
Mark	And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.
Mark	And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.
Mark	And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth [unto him] whom he would: and they came unto him.
Mark	And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,
Mark	And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:
Mark	And Simon he surnamed Peter;
Mark	And James the [son] of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:
Mark	And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
Mark	And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.
Mark	And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
Mark	And when his friends heard [of it], they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.
Mark	And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.
Mark	And he called them [unto him], and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?
Mark	And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
Mark	And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
Mark	And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.
Mark	No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.
Mark	Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:
Mark	But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:
Mark	Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.
Mark	There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.
Mark	And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.
Mark	And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?
Mark	And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
Mark	For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.
Mark	And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.
Mark	And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,
Mark	Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:
Mark	And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.
Mark	And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:
Mark	But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
Mark	And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
Mark	And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.
Mark	And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Mark	And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.
Mark	And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all [these] things are done in parables:
Mark	That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and [their] sins should be forgiven them.
Mark	And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable?
Mark	and how then will ye know all parables?
Mark	The sower soweth the word.
Mark	And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.
Mark	And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;
Mark	And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word’s sake, immediately they are offended.
Mark	And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,
Mark	And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.
Mark	And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive [it], and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.
Mark	And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed?
Mark	and not to be set on a candlestick?
Mark	For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.
Mark	If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
Mark	And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.
Mark	For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.
Mark	And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;
Mark	And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.
Mark	For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.
Mark	But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.
Mark	And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God?
Mark	or with what comparison shall we compare it?
Mark	[It is] like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:
Mark	But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.
Mark	And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear [it].
Mark	But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.
Mark	And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.
Mark	And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship.
Mark	And there were also with him other little ships.
Mark	And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.
Mark	And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?
Mark	And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still.
Mark	And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
Mark	And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful?
Mark	how is it that ye have no faith?
Mark	And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
Mark	And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.
Mark	And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
Mark	Who had [his] dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:
Mark	Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any [man] tame him.
Mark	And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.
Mark	But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,
Mark	And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, [thou] Son of the most high God?
Mark	I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.
Mark	For he said unto him, Come out of the man, [thou] unclean spirit.
Mark	And he asked him, What [is] thy name?
Mark	And he answered, saying, My name [is] Legion: for we are many.
Mark	And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
Mark	Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.
Mark	And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.
Mark	And forthwith Jesus gave them leave.
Mark	And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.
Mark	And they that fed the swine fled, and told [it] in the city, and in the country.
Mark	And they went out to see what it was that was done.
Mark	And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.
Mark	And they that saw [it] told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and [also] concerning the swine.
Mark	And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.
Mark	And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.
Mark	Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.
Mark	And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all [men] did marvel.
Mark	And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.
Mark	And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,
Mark	And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: [I pray thee], come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.
Mark	And [Jesus] went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.
Mark	And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,
Mark	And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,
Mark	When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.
Mark	For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.
Mark	And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in [her] body that she was healed of that plague.
Mark	And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?
Mark	And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?
Mark	And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.
Mark	But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
Mark	And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.
Mark	While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s [house certain] which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?
Mark	As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.
Mark	And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.
Mark	And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.
Mark	And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep?
Mark	the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.
Mark	And they laughed him to scorn.
Mark	But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.
Mark	And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.
Mark	And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was [of the age] of twelve years.
Mark	And they were astonished with a great astonishment.
Mark	And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.
Mark	And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.
Mark	And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing [him] were astonished, saying, From whence hath this [man] these things?
Mark	and what wisdom [is] this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?
Mark	Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon?
Mark	and are not his sisters here with us?
Mark	And they were offended at him.
Mark	But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.
Mark	And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed [them].
Mark	And he marvelled because of their unbelief.
Mark	And he went round about the villages, teaching.
Mark	And he called [unto him] the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;
Mark	And commanded them that they should take nothing for [their] journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in [their] purse:
Mark	But [be] shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.
Mark	And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.
Mark	And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them.
Mark	Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.
Mark	And they went out, and preached that men should repent.
Mark	And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed [them].
Mark	And king Herod heard [of him]; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.
Mark	Others said, That it is Elias.
Mark	And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.
Mark	But when Herod heard [thereof], he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.
Mark	For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife: for he had married her.
Mark	For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife.
Mark	Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:
Mark	For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.
Mark	And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief [estates] of Galilee;
Mark	And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give [it] thee.
Mark	And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give [it] thee, unto the half of my kingdom.
Mark	And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask?
Mark	And she said, The head of John the Baptist.
Mark	And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.
Mark	And the king was exceeding sorry; [yet] for his oath’s sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.
Mark	And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,
Mark	And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.
Mark	And when his disciples heard [of it], they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
Mark	And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.
Mark	And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.
Mark	And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.
Mark	And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.
Mark	And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.
Mark	And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time [is] far passed:
Mark	Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.
Mark	He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat.
Mark	And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?
Mark	He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye?
Mark	go and see.
Mark	And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.
Mark	And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.
Mark	And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.
Mark	And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave [them] to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.
Mark	And they did all eat, and were filled.
Mark	And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.
Mark	And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.
Mark	And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.
Mark	And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.
Mark	And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.
Mark	And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.
Mark	But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:
Mark	For they all saw him, and were troubled.
Mark	And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.
Mark	And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.
Mark	For they considered not [the miracle] of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.
Mark	And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.
Mark	And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,
Mark	And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.
Mark	And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.
Mark	Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.
Mark	And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.
Mark	For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash [their] hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.
Mark	And [when they come] from the market, except they wash, they eat not.
Mark	And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, [as] the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.
Mark	Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?
Mark	He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with [their] lips, but their heart is far from me.
Mark	Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men.
Mark	For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, [as] the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.
Mark	And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.
Mark	For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:
Mark	But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, [It is] Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; [he shall be free].
Mark	And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;
Mark	Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.
Mark	And when he had called all the people [unto him], he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one [of you], and understand:
Mark	There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.
Mark	If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
Mark	And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.
Mark	And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also?
Mark	Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, [it] cannot defile him;
Mark	Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?
Mark	And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.
Mark	For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,
Mark	Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:
Mark	All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.
Mark	And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know [it]: but he could not be hid.
Mark	For a [certain] woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:
Mark	The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.
Mark	But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast [it] unto the dogs.
Mark	And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.
Mark	And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.
Mark	And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.
Mark	And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.
Mark	And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.
Mark	And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;
Mark	And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.
Mark	And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.
Mark	And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published [it];
Mark	And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
Mark	In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples [unto him], and saith unto them,
Mark	I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:
Mark	And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.
Mark	And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these [men] with bread here in the wilderness?
Mark	And he asked them, How many loaves have ye?
Mark	And they said, Seven.
Mark	And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before [them]; and they did set [them] before the people.
Mark	And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before [them].
Mark	So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken [meat] that was left seven baskets.
Mark	And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
Mark	And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
Mark	And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.
Mark	And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign?
Mark	verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.
Mark	And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.
Mark	Now [the disciples] had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.
Mark	And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and [of] the leaven of Herod.
Mark	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, [It is] because we have no bread.
Mark	And when Jesus knew [it], he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread?
Mark	perceive ye not yet, neither understand?
Mark	have ye your heart yet hardened?
Mark	Having eyes, see ye not?
Mark	and having ears, hear ye not?
Mark	and do ye not remember?
Mark	When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?
Mark	They say unto him, Twelve.
Mark	And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?
Mark	And they said, Seven.
Mark	And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?
Mark	And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.
Mark	And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.
Mark	And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.
Mark	After that he put [his] hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.
Mark	And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell [it] to any in the town.
Mark	And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?
Mark	And they answered, John the Baptist: but some [say], Elias; and others, One of the prophets.
Mark	And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?
Mark	And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.
Mark	And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
Mark	And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and [of] the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
Mark	And he spake that saying openly.
Mark	And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.
Mark	But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.
Mark	And when he had called the people [unto him] with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
Mark	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it.
Mark	For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
Mark	Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
Mark	Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
Mark	And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.
Mark	And after six days Jesus taketh [with him] Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.
Mark	And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.
Mark	And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.
Mark	And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
Mark	For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.
Mark	And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
Mark	And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.
Mark	And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.
Mark	And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.
Mark	And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?
Mark	And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.
Mark	But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.
Mark	And when he came to [his] disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.
Mark	And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to [him] saluted him.
Mark	And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?
Mark	And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;
Mark	And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not.
Mark	He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you?
Mark	how long shall I suffer you?
Mark	bring him unto me.
Mark	And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.
Mark	And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him?
Mark	And he said, Of a child.
Mark	And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.
Mark	Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things [are] possible to him that believeth.
Mark	And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.
Mark	When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, [Thou] dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.
Mark	And [the spirit] cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.
Mark	But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.
Mark	And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?
Mark	And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.
Mark	And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know [it].
Mark	For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.
Mark	But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.
Mark	And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?
Mark	But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who [should be] the greatest.
Mark	And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, [the same] shall be last of all, and servant of all.
Mark	And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,
Mark	Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.
Mark	And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.
Mark	But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.
Mark	For he that is not against us is on our part.
Mark	For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.
Mark	And whosoever shall offend one of [these] little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.
Mark	And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
Mark	Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
Mark	And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
Mark	Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
Mark	And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:
Mark	Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
Mark	For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.
Mark	Salt [is] good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it?
Mark	Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.
Mark	And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.
Mark	And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away [his] wife?
Mark	tempting him.
Mark	And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?
Mark	And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put [her] away.
Mark	And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.
Mark	But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.
Mark	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;
Mark	And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.
Mark	What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
Mark	And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same [matter].
Mark	And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.
Mark	And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.
Mark	And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and [his] disciples rebuked those that brought [them].
Mark	But when Jesus saw [it], he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
Mark	Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.
Mark	And he took them up in his arms, put [his] hands upon them, and blessed them.
Mark	And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
Mark	And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good?
Mark	[there is] none good but one, [that is], God.
Mark	Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.
Mark	And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.
Mark	Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.
Mark	And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.
Mark	And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
Mark	And the disciples were astonished at his words.
Mark	But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
Mark	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
Mark	And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?
Mark	And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men [it is] impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.
Mark	Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.
Mark	And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel’s,
Mark	But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.
Mark	But many [that are] first shall be last; and the last first.
Mark	And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid.
Mark	And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,
Mark	[Saying], Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:
Mark	And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.
Mark	And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.
Mark	And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?
Mark	They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.
Mark	But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of?
Mark	and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
Mark	And they said unto him, We can.
Mark	And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:
Mark	But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but [it shall be given to them] for whom it is prepared.
Mark	And when the ten heard [it], they began to be much displeased with James and John.
Mark	But Jesus called them [to him], and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.
Mark	But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:
Mark	And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.
Mark	For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
Mark	And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.
Mark	And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, [thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.
Mark	And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, [Thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.
Mark	And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called.
Mark	And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.
Mark	And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.
Mark	And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee?
Mark	The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.
Mark	And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole.
Mark	And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.
Mark	And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,
Mark	And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring [him].
Mark	And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this?
Mark	say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.
Mark	And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.
Mark	And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?
Mark	And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.
Mark	And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.
Mark	And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed [them] in the way.
Mark	And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed [is] he that cometh in the name of the Lord:
Mark	Blessed [be] the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.
Mark	And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.
Mark	And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:
Mark	And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not [yet].
Mark	And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever.
Mark	And his disciples heard [it].
Mark	And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;
Mark	And would not suffer that any man should carry [any] vessel through the temple.
Mark	And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer?
Mark	but ye have made it a den of thieves.
Mark	And the scribes and chief priests heard [it], and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.
Mark	And when even was come, he went out of the city.
Mark	And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.
Mark	And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.
Mark	And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.
Mark	For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.
Mark	Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive [them], and ye shall have [them].
Mark	And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
Mark	But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.
Mark	And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,
Mark	And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things?
Mark	and who gave thee this authority to do these things?
Mark	And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
Mark	The baptism of John, was [it] from heaven, or of men?
Mark	answer me.
Mark	And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?
Mark	But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all [men] counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.
Mark	And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell.
Mark	And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
Mark	And he began to speak unto them by parables.
Mark	A [certain] man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about [it], and digged [a place for] the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.
Mark	And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.
Mark	And they caught [him], and beat him, and sent [him] away empty.
Mark	And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded [him] in the head, and sent [him] away shamefully handled.
Mark	And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.
Mark	Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.
Mark	But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.
Mark	And they took him, and killed [him], and cast [him] out of the vineyard.
Mark	What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do?
Mark	he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.
Mark	And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:
Mark	This was the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
Mark	And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.
Mark	And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in [his] words.
Mark	And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
Mark	Shall we give, or shall we not give?
Mark	But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me?
Mark	bring me a penny, that I may see [it].
Mark	And they brought [it].
Mark	And he saith unto them, Whose [is] this image and superscription?
Mark	And they said unto him, Caesar’s.
Mark	And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.
Mark	And they marvelled at him.
Mark	Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,
Mark	Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave [his] wife [behind him], and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
Mark	Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.
Mark	And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.
Mark	And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.
Mark	In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them?
Mark	for the seven had her to wife.
Mark	And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?
Mark	For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.
Mark	And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I [am] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
Mark	He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.
Mark	And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?
Mark	And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments [is], Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:
Mark	And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this [is] the first commandment.
Mark	And the second [is] like, [namely] this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
Mark	There is none other commandment greater than these.
Mark	And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:
Mark	And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love [his] neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.
Mark	And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.
Mark	And no man after that durst ask him [any question].
Mark	And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?
Mark	For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.
Mark	David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he [then] his son?
Mark	And the common people heard him gladly.
Mark	And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and [love] salutations in the marketplaces,
Mark	And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:
Mark	Which devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.
Mark	And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.
Mark	And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.
Mark	And he called [unto him] his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:
Mark	For all [they] did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, [even] all her living.
Mark	And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings [are here]!
Mark	And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings?
Mark	there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
Mark	And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,
Mark	Tell us, when shall these things be?
Mark	and what [shall be] the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?
Mark	And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any [man] deceive you:
Mark	For many shall come in my name, saying, I am [Christ]; and shall deceive many.
Mark	And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for [such things] must needs be; but the end [shall] not [be] yet.
Mark	For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these [are] the beginnings of sorrows.
Mark	But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.
Mark	And the gospel must first be published among all nations.
Mark	But when they shall lead [you], and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.
Mark	Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against [their] parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.
Mark	And ye shall be hated of all [men] for my name’s sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
Mark	But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:
Mark	And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter [therein], to take any thing out of his house:
Mark	And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.
Mark	But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!
Mark	And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.
Mark	For [in] those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.
Mark	And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect’s sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.
Mark	And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here [is] Christ; or, lo, [he is] there; believe [him] not:
Mark	For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if [it were] possible, even the elect.
Mark	But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.
Mark	But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
Mark	And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.
Mark	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
Mark	And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.
Mark	Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:
Mark	So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, [even] at the doors.
Mark	Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.
Mark	Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
Mark	But of that day and [that] hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.
Mark	Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.
Mark	[For the Son of man is] as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.
Mark	Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:
Mark	Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.
Mark	And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.
Mark	After two days was [the feast of] the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put [him] to death.
Mark	But they said, Not on the feast [day], lest there be an uproar of the people.
Mark	And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured [it] on his head.
Mark	And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?
Luke	Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,
Luke	Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;
Luke	It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,
Luke	That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.
Luke	There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife [was] of the daughters of Aaron, and her name [was] Elisabeth.
Luke	And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.
Luke	And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were [now] well stricken in years.
Luke	And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course,
Luke	According to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.
Luke	And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.
Luke	And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
Luke	And when Zacharias saw [him], he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.
Luke	But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.
Luke	And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.
Luke	For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother’s womb.
Luke	And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.
Luke	And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
Luke	And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this?
Luke	for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.
Luke	And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.
Luke	And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.
Luke	And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.
Luke	And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.
Luke	And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.
Luke	And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,
Luke	Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on [me], to take away my reproach among men.
Luke	And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
Luke	To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name [was] Mary.
Luke	And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, [thou that art] highly favoured, the Lord [is] with thee: blessed [art] thou among women.
Luke	And when she saw [him], she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.
Luke	And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.
Luke	And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.
Luke	He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:
Luke	And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
Luke	Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
Luke	And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
Luke	And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.
Luke	For with God nothing shall be impossible.
Luke	And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.
Luke	And the angel departed from her.
Luke	And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;
Luke	And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.
Luke	And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:
Luke	And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed [art] thou among women, and blessed [is] the fruit of thy womb.
Luke	And whence [is] this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
Luke	For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.
Luke	And blessed [is] she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.
Luke	And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,
Luke	And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
Luke	For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
Luke	For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy [is] his name.
Luke	And his mercy [is] on them that fear him from generation to generation.
Luke	He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
Luke	He hath put down the mighty from [their] seats, and exalted them of low degree.
Luke	He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.
Luke	He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of [his] mercy;
Luke	As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.
Luke	And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.
Luke	Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.
Luke	And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.
Luke	And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.
Luke	And his mother answered and said, Not [so]; but he shall be called John.
Luke	And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.
Luke	And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.
Luke	And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John.
Luke	And they marvelled all.
Luke	And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue [loosed], and he spake, and praised God.
Luke	And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.
Luke	And all they that heard [them] laid [them] up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be!
Luke	And the hand of the Lord was with him.
Luke	And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,
Luke	Blessed [be] the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,
Luke	And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;
Luke	As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:
Luke	That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;
Luke	To perform the mercy [promised] to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;
Luke	The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,
Luke	That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,
Luke	In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.
Luke	And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;
Luke	To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,
Luke	Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,
Luke	To give light to them that sit in darkness and [in] the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
Luke	And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.
Luke	And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.
Luke	([And] this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)
Luke	And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.
Luke	And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)
Luke	To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.
Luke	And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.
Luke	And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.
Luke	And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.
Luke	And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.
Luke	And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.
Luke	For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.
Luke	And this [shall be] a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.
Luke	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,
Luke	Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.
Luke	And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.
Luke	And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.
Luke	And when they had seen [it], they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.
Luke	And all they that heard [it] wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.
Luke	But Mary kept all these things, and pondered [them] in her heart.
Luke	And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.
Luke	And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
Luke	And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present [him] to the Lord;
Luke	(As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)
Luke	And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.
Luke	And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name [was] Simeon; and the same man [was] just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.
Luke	And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.
Luke	And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,
Luke	Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,
Luke	Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:
Luke	For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,
Luke	Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;
Luke	A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.
Luke	And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.
Luke	And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this [child] is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;
Luke	(Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.
Luke	And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;
Luke	And she [was] a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served [God] with fastings and prayers night and day.
Luke	And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.
Luke	And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.
Luke	And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.
Luke	Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.
Luke	And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.
Luke	And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not [of it].
Luke	But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day’s journey; and they sought him among [their] kinsfolk and acquaintance.
Luke	And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.
Luke	And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.
Luke	And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.
Luke	And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us?
Luke	behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.
Luke	And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me?
Luke	wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s business?
Luke	And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.
Luke	And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
Luke	And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.
Luke	Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,
Luke	Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
Luke	And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;
Luke	As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
Luke	Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways [shall be] made smooth;
Luke	And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.
Luke	Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Luke	Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to [our] father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
Luke	And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
Luke	And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?
Luke	He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.
Luke	Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do?
Luke	And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you.
Luke	And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do?
Luke	And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse [any] falsely; and be content with your wages.
Luke	And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;
Luke	John answered, saying unto [them] all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:
Luke	Whose fan [is] in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.
Luke	And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people.
Luke	But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip’s wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,
Luke	Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.
Luke	Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,
Luke	And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.
Luke	And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was [the son] of Heli,
Luke	Which was [the son] of Matthat, which was [the son] of Levi, which was [the son] of Melchi, which was [the son] of Janna, which was [the son] of Joseph,
Luke	Which was [the son] of Mattathias, which was [the son] of Amos, which was [the son] of Naum, which was [the son] of Esli, which was [the son] of Nagge,

Luke	Which was [the son] of Joanna, which was [the son] of Rhesa, which was [the son] of Zorobabel, which was [the son] of Salathiel, which was [the son] of Neri,
Luke	Which was [the son] of Melchi, which was [the son] of Addi, which was [the son] of Cosam, which was [the son] of Elmodam, which was [the son] of Er,
Luke	Which was [the son] of Jose, which was [the son] of Eliezer, which was [the son] of Jorim, which was [the son] of Matthat, which was [the son] of Levi,
Luke	Which was [the son] of Simeon, which was [the son] of Juda, which was [the son] of Joseph, which was [the son] of Jonan, which was [the son] of Eliakim,
Luke	Which was [the son] of Melea, which was [the son] of Menan, which was [the son] of Mattatha, which was [the son] of Nathan, which was [the son] of David,
Luke	Which was [the son] of Jesse, which was [the son] of Obed, which was [the son] of Booz, which was [the son] of Salmon, which was [the son] of Naasson,
Luke	Which was [the son] of Aminadab, which was [the son] of Aram, which was [the son] of Esrom, which was [the son] of Phares, which was [the son] of Juda,
Luke	Which was [the son] of Jacob, which was [the son] of Isaac, which was [the son] of Abraham, which was [the son] of Thara, which was [the son] of Nachor,
Luke	Which was [the son] of Saruch, which was [the son] of Ragau, which was [the son] of Phalec, which was [the son] of Heber, which was [the son] of Sala,
Luke	Which was [the son] of Cainan, which was [the son] of Arphaxad, which was [the son] of Sem, which was [the son] of Noe, which was [the son] of Lamech,
Luke	Which was [the son] of Mathusala, which was [the son] of Enoch, which was [the son] of Jared, which was [the son] of Maleleel, which was [the son] of Cainan,
Luke	Which was [the son] of Enos, which was [the son] of Seth, which was [the son] of Adam, which was [the son] of God.
Luke	And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,
Luke	Being forty days tempted of the devil.
Luke	And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered.
Luke	And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.
Luke	And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.
Luke	And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
Luke	And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.
Luke	If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.
Luke	And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
Luke	And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence:
Luke	For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee:
Luke	And in [their] hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Luke	And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
Luke	And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.
Luke	And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.
Luke	And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.
Luke	And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.
Luke	And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias.
Luke	And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,
Luke	The Spirit of the Lord [is] upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,
Luke	To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
Luke	And he closed the book, and he gave [it] again to the minister, and sat down.
Luke	And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.
Luke	And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.
Luke	And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth.
Luke	And they said, Is not this Joseph’s son?
Luke	And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.
Luke	And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.
Luke	But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;
Luke	But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, [a city] of Sidon, unto a woman [that was] a widow.
Luke	And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.
Luke	And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,
Luke	And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.
Luke	But he passing through the midst of them went his way,
Luke	And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.
Luke	And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.
Luke	And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,
Luke	Saying, Let [us] alone; what have we to do with thee, [thou] Jesus of Nazareth?
Luke	art thou come to destroy us?
Luke	I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.
Luke	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.
Luke	And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not.
Luke	And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word [is] this!
Luke	for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.
Luke	And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.
Luke	And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s house.
Luke	And Simon’s wife’s mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her.
Luke	And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.
Luke	Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.
Luke	And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God.
Luke	And he rebuking [them] suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.
Luke	And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.
Luke	And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.
Luke	And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.
Luke	And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,
Luke	And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing [their] nets.
Luke	And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land.
Luke	And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.
Luke	Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.
Luke	And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.
Luke	And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.
Luke	And they beckoned unto [their] partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them.
Luke	And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.
Luke	When Simon Peter saw [it], he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.
Luke	For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:
Luke	And so [was] also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon.
Luke	And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.
Luke	And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.
Luke	And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on [his] face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
Luke	And he put forth [his] hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean.
Luke	And immediately the leprosy departed from him.
Luke	And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
Luke	But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.
Luke	And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.
Luke	And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was [present] to heal them.
Luke	And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought [means] to bring him in, and to lay [him] before him.
Luke	And when they could not find by what [way] they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with [his] couch into the midst before Jesus.
Luke	And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.
Luke	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies?
Luke	Who can forgive sins, but God alone?
Luke	But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?
Luke	Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?
Luke	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.
Luke	And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.
Luke	And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.
Luke	And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.
Luke	And he left all, rose up, and followed him.
Luke	And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.
Luke	But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?
Luke	And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.
Luke	I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
Luke	And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise [the disciples] of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?
Luke	And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?
Luke	But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.
Luke	And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was [taken] out of the new agreeth not with the old.
Luke	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.
Luke	But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.
Luke	No man also having drunk old [wine] straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.
Luke	And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing [them] in [their] hands.
Luke	And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?
Luke	And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him;
Luke	How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?
Luke	And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
Luke	And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.
Luke	And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.
Luke	But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst.
Luke	And he arose and stood forth.
Luke	Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil?
Luke	to save life, or to destroy [it]?
Luke	And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand.
Luke	And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
Luke	And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.
Luke	And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.
Luke	And when it was day, he called [unto him] his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;
Luke	Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,
Luke	Matthew and Thomas, James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,
Luke	And Judas [the brother] of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.
Luke	And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;
Luke	And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.
Luke	And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed [them] all.
Luke	And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed [be ye] poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.
Luke	Blessed [are ye] that hunger now: for ye shall be filled.
Luke	Blessed [are ye] that weep now: for ye shall laugh.
Luke	Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you [from their company], and shall reproach [you], and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.
Luke	Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward [is] great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.
Luke	But woe unto you that are rich!
Luke	for ye have received your consolation.
Luke	Woe unto you that are full!
Luke	for ye shall hunger.
Luke	Woe unto you that laugh now!
Luke	for ye shall mourn and weep.
Luke	Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you!
Luke	for so did their fathers to the false prophets.
Luke	But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,
Luke	Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.
Luke	And unto him that smiteth thee on the [one] cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not [to take thy] coat also.
Luke	Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask [them] not again.
Luke	And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.
Luke	For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye?
Luke	for sinners also love those that love them.
Luke	And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye?
Luke	for sinners also do even the same.
Luke	And if ye lend [to them] of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye?
Luke	for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.
Luke	But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and [to] the evil.
Luke	Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.
Luke	Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:
Luke	Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom.
Luke	For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.
Luke	And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind?
Luke	shall they not both fall into the ditch?
Luke	The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.
Luke	And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
Luke	Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
Luke	Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother’s eye.
Luke	For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
Luke	For every tree is known by his own fruit.
Luke	For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.
Luke	A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.
Luke	And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?
Luke	Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:
Luke	He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.
Luke	But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.
Luke	Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.
Luke	And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.
Luke	And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.
Luke	And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:
Luke	For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.
Luke	Then Jesus went with them.
Luke	And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:
Luke	Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.
Luke	For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth [it].
Luke	When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
Luke	And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.
Luke	And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.
Luke	Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.
Luke	And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.
Luke	And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare [him] stood still.
Luke	And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.
Luke	And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak.
Luke	And he delivered him to his mother.
Luke	And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.
Luke	And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.
Luke	And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.
Luke	And John calling [unto him] two of his disciples sent [them] to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come?
Luke	or look we for another?
Luke	When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come?
Luke	or look we for another?
Luke	And in that same hour he cured many of [their] infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many [that were] blind he gave sight.
Luke	Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.
Luke	And blessed is [he], whosoever shall not be offended in me.
Luke	And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see?
Luke	A reed shaken with the wind?
Luke	But what went ye out for to see?
Luke	A man clothed in soft raiment?
Luke	Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts.
Luke	But what went ye out for to see?
Luke	A prophet?
Luke	Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.
Luke	This is [he], of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
Luke	For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
Luke	And all the people that heard [him], and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.
Luke	But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.
Luke	And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation?
Luke	and to what are they like?
Luke	They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.
Luke	For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.
Luke	The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!
Luke	But wisdom is justified of all her children.
Luke	And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him.
Luke	And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.
Luke	And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that [Jesus] sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,
Luke	And stood at his feet behind [him] weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe [them] with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed [them] with the ointment.
Luke	Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw [it], he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman [this is] that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.
Luke	And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee.
Luke	And he saith, Master, say on.
Luke	There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.
Luke	And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both.
Luke	Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?
Luke	Simon answered and said, I suppose that [he], to whom he forgave most.
Luke	And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.
Luke	And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman?
Luke	I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped [them] with the hairs of her head.
Luke	Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.
Luke	My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.
Luke	Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, [the same] loveth little.
Luke	And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.
Luke	And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?
Luke	And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.
Luke	And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve [were] with him,
Luke	And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,
Luke	And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.
Luke	And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:
Luke	A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.
Luke	And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.
Luke	And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.
Luke	And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold.
Luke	And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Luke	And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?
Luke	And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.
Luke	Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
Luke	Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.
Luke	They on the rock [are they], which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.
Luke	And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of [this] life, and bring no fruit to perfection.
Luke	But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep [it], and bring forth fruit with patience.
Luke	No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth [it] under a bed; but setteth [it] on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.
Luke	For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither [any thing] hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.
Luke	Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.
Luke	Then came to him [his] mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.
Luke	And it was told him [by certain] which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.
Luke	And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.
Luke	Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake.
Luke	And they launched forth.
Luke	But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled [with water], and were in jeopardy.
Luke	And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish.
Luke	Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.
Luke	And he said unto them, Where is your faith?
Luke	And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this!
Luke	for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.
Luke	And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.
Luke	And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in [any] house, but in the tombs.
Luke	When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, [thou] Son of God most high?
Luke	I beseech thee, torment me not.
Luke	(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man.
Luke	For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)
Luke	And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name?
Luke	And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.
Luke	And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.
Luke	And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them.
Luke	And he suffered them.
Luke	Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.
Luke	When they that fed [them] saw what was done, they fled, and went and told [it] in the city and in the country.
Luke	Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.
Luke	They also which saw [it] told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.
Luke	Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.
Luke	Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,
Luke	Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee.
Luke	And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.
Luke	And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people [gladly] received him: for they were all waiting for him.
Luke	And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:
Luke	For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying.
Luke	But as he went the people thronged him.
Luke	And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,
Luke	Came behind [him], and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.
Luke	And Jesus said, Who touched me?
Luke	When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press [thee], and sayest thou, Who touched me?
Luke	And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.
Luke	And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
Luke	And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.
Luke	While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue’s [house], saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.
Luke	But when Jesus heard [it], he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.
Luke	And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.
Luke	And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.
Luke	And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.
Luke	And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.
Luke	And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.
Luke	And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.
Luke	Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.
Luke	And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.
Luke	And he said unto them, Take nothing for [your] journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.
Luke	And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart.
Luke	And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.
Luke	And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.
Luke	Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;
Luke	And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.
Luke	And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things?
Luke	And he desired to see him.
Luke	And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done.
Luke	And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.
Luke	And the people, when they knew [it], followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.
Luke	And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.
Luke	But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat.
Luke	And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people.
Luke	For they were about five thousand men.
Luke	And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.
Luke	And they did so, and made them all sit down.
Luke	Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.
Luke	And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.
Luke	And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?
Luke	They answering said, John the Baptist; but some [say], Elias; and others [say], that one of the old prophets is risen again.
Luke	He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am?
Luke	Peter answering said, The Christ of God.
Luke	And he straitly charged them, and commanded [them] to tell no man that thing;
Luke	Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.
Luke	And he said to [them] all, If any [man] will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.
Luke	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.
Luke	For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?
Luke	For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and [in his] Father’s, and of the holy angels.
Luke	But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.
Luke	And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.
Luke	And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment [was] white [and] glistering.
Luke	And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:
Luke	Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.
Luke	But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.
Luke	And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.
Luke	While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.
Luke	And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
Luke	And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone.
Luke	And they kept [it] close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.
Luke	And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.
Luke	And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.
Luke	And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.
Luke	And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.
Luke	And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you?
Luke	Bring thy son hither.
Luke	And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare [him].
Luke	And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.
Luke	And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God.
Luke	But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,
Luke	Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.
Luke	But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.
Luke	Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.
Luke	And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,
Luke	And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.
Luke	And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.
Luke	And Jesus said unto him, Forbid [him] not: for he that is not against us is for us.
Luke	And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,
Luke	And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.
Luke	And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.
Luke	And when his disciples James and John saw [this], they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?
Luke	But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.
Luke	For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save [them].
Luke	And they went to another village.
Luke	And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain [man] said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
Luke	And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air [have] nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay [his] head.
Luke	And he said unto another, Follow me.
Luke	But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
Luke	Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.
Luke	And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.
Luke	And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
Luke	After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.
Luke	Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly [is] great, but the labourers [are] few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.
Luke	Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.
Luke	Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.
Luke	And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace [be] to this house.
Luke	And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.
Luke	And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire.
Luke	Go not from house to house.
Luke	And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:
Luke	And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.
Luke	But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,
Luke	Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.
Luke	But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.
Luke	Woe unto thee, Chorazin!
Luke	woe unto thee, Bethsaida!
Luke	for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
Luke	But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.
Luke	And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell.
Luke	He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.
Luke	And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name.
Luke	And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.
Luke	Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
Luke	Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.
Luke	In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.
Luke	All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and [he] to whom the Son will reveal [him].
Luke	And he turned him unto [his] disciples, and said privately, Blessed [are] the eyes which see the things that ye see:
Luke	For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen [them]; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard [them].
Luke	And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
Luke	He said unto him, What is written in the law?
Luke	how readest thou?
Luke	And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.
Luke	And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.
Luke	But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?
Luke	And Jesus answering said, A certain [man] went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded [him], and departed, leaving [him] half dead.
Luke	And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
Luke	And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked [on him], and passed by on the other side.
Luke	But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion [on him],
Luke	And went to [him], and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
Luke	And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave [them] to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.
Luke	Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?
Luke	And he said, He that shewed mercy on him.
Luke	Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.
Luke	Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.
Luke	And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus’ feet, and heard his word.
Luke	But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone?
Luke	bid her therefore that she help me.
Luke	And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:
Luke	But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.
Luke	And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.
Luke	And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
Luke	Thy kingdom come.
Luke	Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.
Luke	Give us day by day our daily bread.
Luke	And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us.
Luke	And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.
Luke	And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;
Luke	For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?
Luke	And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.
Luke	I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.
Luke	And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
Luke	For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
Luke	If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone?
Luke	or if [he ask] a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?
Luke	Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?
Luke	If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall [your] heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?
Luke	And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb.
Luke	And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.
Luke	But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.
Luke	And others, tempting [him], sought of him a sign from heaven.
Luke	But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house [divided] against a house falleth.
Luke	If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand?
Luke	because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.
Luke	And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast [them] out?
Luke	therefore shall they be your judges.
Luke	But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.
Luke	When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:
Luke	But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.
Luke	He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.
Luke	When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.
Luke	And when he cometh, he findeth [it] swept and garnished.
Luke	Then goeth he, and taketh [to him] seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last [state] of that man is worse than the first.
Luke	And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed [is] the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.
Luke	But he said, Yea rather, blessed [are] they that hear the word of God, and keep it.
Luke	And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.
Luke	For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.
Luke	The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon [is] here.
Luke	The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas [is] here.
Luke	No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth [it] in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.
Luke	The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when [thine eye] is evil, thy body also [is] full of darkness.
Luke	Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.
Luke	If thy whole body therefore [be] full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.
Luke	And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.
Luke	And when the Pharisee saw [it], he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.
Luke	And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.
Luke	[Ye] fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?
Luke	But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.
Luke	But woe unto you, Pharisees!
Luke	for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
Luke	Woe unto you, Pharisees!
Luke	for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.
Luke	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
Luke	for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over [them] are not aware [of them].
Luke	Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.
Luke	And he said, Woe unto you also, [ye] lawyers!
Luke	for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.
Luke	Woe unto you!
Luke	for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
Luke	Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.
Luke	Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and [some] of them they shall slay and persecute:
Luke	That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
Luke	From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.
Luke	Woe unto you, lawyers!
Luke	for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.
Luke	And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge [him] vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:
Luke	Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.
Luke	In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
Luke	For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.
Luke	Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.
Luke	And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
Luke	But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.
Luke	Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?
Luke	But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
Luke	Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.
Luke	Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:
Luke	But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.
Luke	And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.
Luke	And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and [unto] magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:
Luke	For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.
Luke	And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.
Luke	And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?
Luke	And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.
Luke	And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:
Luke	And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?
Luke	And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.
Luke	And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, [and] be merry.
Luke	But God said unto him, [Thou] fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?
Luke	So [is] he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.
Luke	And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.
Luke	The life is more than meat, and the body [is more] than raiment.
Luke	Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?
Luke	And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?
Luke	If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?
Luke	Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
Luke	If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more [will he clothe] you, O ye of little faith?
Luke	And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.
Luke	For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.
Luke	But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.
Luke	Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
Luke	Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.
Luke	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
Luke	Let your loins be girded about, and [your] lights burning;
Luke	And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.
Luke	Blessed [are] those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.
Luke	And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find [them] so, blessed are those servants.
Luke	And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.
Luke	Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.
Luke	Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?
Luke	And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom [his] lord shall make ruler over his household, to give [them their] portion of meat in due season?
Luke	Blessed [is] that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.
Luke	Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.
Luke	But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;
Luke	The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for [him], and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.
Luke	And that servant, which knew his lord’s will, and prepared not [himself], neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many [stripes].
Luke	But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few [stripes].
Luke	For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.
Luke	I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?
Luke	But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!
Luke	Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth?
Luke	I tell you, Nay; but rather division:
Luke	For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.
Luke	The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.
Luke	And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.
Luke	And when [ye see] the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass.
Luke	[Ye] hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?
Luke	Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?
Luke	When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, [as thou art] in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.
Luke	I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite.
Luke	There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
Luke	And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?
Luke	I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
Luke	Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?
Luke	I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
Luke	He spake also this parable; A certain [man] had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.
Luke	Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?
Luke	And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung [it]:
Luke	And if it bear fruit, [well]: and if not, [then] after that thou shalt cut it down.
Luke	And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.
Luke	And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up [herself].
Luke	And when Jesus saw her, he called [her to him], and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.
Luke	And he laid [his] hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.
Luke	And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.
Luke	The Lord then answered him, and said, [Thou] hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or [his] ass from the stall, and lead [him] away to watering?
Luke	And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?
Luke	And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
Luke	Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like?
Luke	and whereunto shall I resemble it?
Luke	It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.
Luke	And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?
Luke	It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
Luke	And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.
Luke	Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved?
Luke	And he said unto them,
Luke	Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.
Luke	When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:
Luke	Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.
Luke	But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all [ye] workers of iniquity.
Luke	There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you [yourselves] thrust out.
Luke	And they shall come from the east, and [from] the west, and from the north, and [from] the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.
Luke	And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.
Luke	The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.
Luke	And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third [day] I shall be perfected.
Luke	Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the [day] following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.
Luke	O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen [doth gather] her brood under [her] wings, and ye would not!
Luke	Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until [the time] come when ye shall say, Blessed [is] he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
Luke	And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him.
Luke	And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy.
Luke	And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?
Luke	And they held their peace.
Luke	And he took [him], and healed him, and let him go;
Luke	And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?
Luke	And they could not answer him again to these things.
Luke	And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them,
Luke	When thou art bidden of any [man] to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;
Luke	And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.
Luke	But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee.
Luke	For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
Luke	Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor [thy] rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.
Luke	But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:
Luke	And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.
Luke	And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed [is] he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
Luke	Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:
Luke	And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.
Luke	And they all with one [consent] began to make excuse.
Luke	The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.
Luke	And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.
Luke	And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.
Luke	So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things.
Luke	Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.
Luke	And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.
Luke	And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel [them] to come in, that my house may be filled.
Luke	For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper.
Luke	And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them,
Luke	If any [man] come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.
Luke	And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.
Luke	For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have [sufficient] to finish [it]?
Luke	Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish [it], all that behold [it] begin to mock him,
Luke	Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.
Luke	Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?
Luke	Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.
Luke	So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.
Luke	Salt [is] good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?
Luke	It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; [but] men cast it out.
Luke	He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Luke	Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.
Luke	And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.
Luke	And he spake this parable unto them, saying,
Luke	What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?
Luke	And when he hath found [it], he layeth [it] on his shoulders, rejoicing.
Luke	And when he cometh home, he calleth together [his] friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.
Luke	I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.
Luke	Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find [it]?
Luke	And when she hath found [it], she calleth [her] friends and [her] neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.
Luke	Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.
Luke	And he said, A certain man had two sons:
Luke	And the younger of them said to [his] father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth [to me].
Luke	And he divided unto them [his] living.
Luke	And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.
Luke	And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.
Luke	And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
Luke	And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.
Luke	And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!
Luke	I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,
Luke	And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.
Luke	And he arose, and came to his father.
Luke	But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
Luke	And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.
Luke	But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put [it] on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on [his] feet:
Luke	And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill [it]; and let us eat, and be merry:
Luke	For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.
Luke	And they began to be merry.
Luke	Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.
Luke	And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.
Luke	And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.
Luke	And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.
Luke	And he answering said to [his] father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:
Luke	But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.
Luke	And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.
Luke	It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.
Luke	And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.
Luke	And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee?
Luke	give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.
Luke	Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do?
Luke	for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.
Luke	I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.
Luke	So he called every one of his lord’s debtors [unto him], and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?
Luke	And he said, An hundred measures of oil.
Luke	And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.
Luke	Then said he to another, And how much owest thou?
Luke	And he said, An hundred measures of wheat.
Luke	And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.
Luke	And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.
Luke	And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.
Luke	He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.
Luke	If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true [riches]?
Luke	And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that which is your own?
Luke	No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.
Luke	Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
Luke	And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.
Luke	And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.
Luke	The law and the prophets [were] until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.
Luke	And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.
Luke	Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from [her] husband committeth adultery.
Luke	There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
Luke	And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,
Luke	And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
Luke	And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;
Luke	And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
Luke	And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
Luke	But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
Luke	And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that [would come] from thence.
Luke	Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house:
Luke	For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
Luke	Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
Luke	And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.
Luke	And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.
Luke	Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe [unto him], through whom they come!
Luke	It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.
Luke	Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.
Luke	And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.
Luke	And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.
Luke	And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.
Luke	But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?
Luke	And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?
Luke	Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him?
Luke	I trow not.
Luke	So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.
Luke	And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
Luke	And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:
Luke	And they lifted up [their] voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.
Luke	And when he saw [them], he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests.
Luke	And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.
Luke	And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,
Luke	And fell down on [his] face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.
Luke	And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed?
Luke	but where [are] the nine?
Luke	There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.
Luke	And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.
Luke	And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:
Luke	Neither shall they say, Lo here!
Luke	or, lo there!
Luke	for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.
Luke	And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see [it].
Luke	And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after [them], nor follow [them].
Luke	For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one [part] under heaven, shineth unto the other [part] under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.
Luke	But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.
Luke	And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.
Luke	They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.
Luke	Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;
Luke	But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed [them] all.
Luke	Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.
Luke	In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.
Luke	Remember Lot’s wife.
Luke	Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.
Luke	I tell you, in that night there shall be two [men] in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.
Luke	Two [women] shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
Luke	Two [men] shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
Luke	And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord?
Luke	And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body [is], thither will the eagles be gathered together.
Luke	And he spake a parable unto them [to this end], that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;
Luke	Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:
Luke	And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.
Luke	And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;
Luke	Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.
Luke	And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.
Luke	And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?
Luke	I tell you that he will avenge them speedily.
Luke	Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?
Luke	And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:
Luke	Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
Luke	The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men [are], extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.
Luke	I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.
Luke	And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as [his] eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.
Luke	I tell you, this man went down to his house justified [rather] than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
Luke	And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when [his] disciples saw [it], they rebuked them.
Luke	But Jesus called them [unto him], and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
Luke	Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.
Luke	And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
Luke	And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good?
Luke	none [is] good, save one, [that is], God.
Luke	Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.
Luke	And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.
Luke	Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
Luke	And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.
Luke	And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
Luke	For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
Luke	And they that heard [it] said, Who then can be saved?
Luke	And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.
Luke	Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.
Luke	And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God’s sake,
Luke	Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.
Luke	Then he took [unto him] the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.
Luke	For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:
Luke	And they shall scourge [him], and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.
Luke	And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.
Luke	And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:
Luke	And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.
Luke	And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.
Luke	And he cried, saying, Jesus, [thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.
Luke	And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, [Thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.
Luke	And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,
Luke	Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee?
Luke	And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
Luke	And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.
Luke	And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw [it], gave praise unto God.
Luke	And [Jesus] entered and passed through Jericho.
Luke	And, behold, [there was] a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.
Luke	And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.
Luke	And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that [way].
Luke	And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.
Luke	And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.
Luke	And when they saw [it], they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.
Luke	And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore [him] fourfold.
Luke	And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.
Luke	For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
Luke	And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.
Luke	He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.
Luke	And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.
Luke	But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this [man] to reign over us.
Luke	And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.
Luke	Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.
Luke	And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.
Luke	And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.
Luke	And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.
Luke	And another came, saying, Lord, behold, [here is] thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:
Luke	For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.
Luke	And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, [thou] wicked servant.
Luke	Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:
Luke	Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?
Luke	And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give [it] to him that hath ten pounds.
Luke	(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)
Luke	For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.
Luke	But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay [them] before me.
Luke	And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.
Luke	And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called [the mount] of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
Luke	Saying, Go ye into the village over against [you]; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring [him hither].
Luke	And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose [him]?
Luke	thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.
Luke	And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.
Luke	And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?
Luke	And they said, The Lord hath need of him.
Luke	And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.
Luke	And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.
Luke	And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;
Luke	Saying, Blessed [be] the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.
Luke	And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.
Luke	And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.
Luke	And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,
Luke	Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things [which belong] unto thy peace!
Luke	but now they are hid from thine eyes.
Luke	For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,
Luke	And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.
Luke	And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;
Luke	Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.
Luke	And he taught daily in the temple.
Luke	But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,
Luke	And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.
Luke	And it came to pass, [that] on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon [him] with the elders,
Luke	And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things?
Luke	or who is he that gave thee this authority?
Luke	And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:
Luke	The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?
Luke	And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?
Luke	But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.
Luke	And they answered, that they could not tell whence [it was].
Luke	And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
Luke	Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.
Luke	And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent [him] away empty.
Luke	And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated [him] shamefully, and sent [him] away empty.
Luke	And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast [him] out.
Luke	Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do?
Luke	I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence [him] when they see him.
Luke	But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.
Luke	So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed [him].
Luke	What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?
Luke	He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others.
Luke	And when they heard [it], they said, God forbid.
Luke	And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?
Luke	Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
Luke	And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.
Luke	And they watched [him], and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.
Luke	And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person [of any], but teachest the way of God truly:
Luke	Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?
Luke	But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?
Luke	Shew me a penny.
Luke	Whose image and superscription hath it?
Luke	They answered and said, Caesar’s.
Luke	And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar’s, and unto God the things which be God’s.
Luke	And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.
Luke	Then came to [him] certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,
Luke	Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man’s brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
Luke	There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.
Luke	And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.
Luke	And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.
Luke	Last of all the woman died also.
Luke	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she?
Luke	for seven had her to wife.
Luke	And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:
Luke	But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:
Luke	Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.
Luke	Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
Luke	For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.
Luke	Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.
Luke	And after that they durst not ask him any [question at all].
Luke	And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David’s son?
Luke	And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
Luke	Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.
Luke	David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?
Luke	Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,
Luke	Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;
Luke	Which devour widows’ houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.
Luke	And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.
Luke	And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.
Luke	And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:
Luke	For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.
Luke	And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,
Luke	[As for] these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
Luke	And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be?
Luke	and what sign [will there be] when these things shall come to pass?
Luke	And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am [Christ]; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.
Luke	But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end [is] not by and by.
Luke	Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
Luke	And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.
Luke	But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute [you], delivering [you] up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name’s sake.
Luke	And it shall turn to you for a testimony.
Luke	Settle [it] therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:
Luke	For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.
Luke	And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and [some] of you shall they cause to be put to death.
Luke	And ye shall be hated of all [men] for my name’s sake.
Luke	But there shall not an hair of your head perish.
Luke	In your patience possess ye your souls.
Luke	And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.
Luke	Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.
Luke	For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
Luke	But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days!
Luke	for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.
Luke	And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.
Luke	And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;
Luke	Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.
Luke	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
Luke	And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.
Luke	And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;
Luke	When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand.
Luke	So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.
Luke	Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.
Luke	Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
Luke	And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and [so] that day come upon you unawares.
Luke	For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.
Luke	Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
Luke	And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called [the mount] of Olives.
Luke	And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.
Luke	Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.
Luke	And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.
Luke	Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
Luke	And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.
Luke	And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
Luke	And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.
Luke	Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.
Luke	And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.
Luke	And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?
Luke	And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.
Luke	And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
Luke	And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.
Luke	And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
Luke	And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.
Luke	And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:
Luke	For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
Luke	And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide [it] among yourselves:
Luke	For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.
Luke	And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake [it], and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.
Luke	Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup [is] the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.
Luke	But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me [is] with me on the table.
Luke	And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!
Luke	And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.
Luke	And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.
Luke	And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.
Luke	But ye [shall] not [be] so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.
Luke	For whether [is] greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth?
Luke	[is] not he that sitteth at meat?
Luke	but I am among you as he that serveth.
Luke	Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.
Luke	And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;
Luke	That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Luke	And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired [to have] you, that he may sift [you] as wheat:
Luke	But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.
Luke	And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.
Luke	And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.
Luke	And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing?
Luke	And they said, Nothing.
Luke	Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take [it], and likewise [his] scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.
Luke	For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.
Luke	And they said, Lord, behold, here [are] two swords.
Luke	And he said unto them, It is enough.
Luke	And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.
Luke	And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.
Luke	And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,
Luke	Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.
Luke	And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.
Luke	And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
Luke	And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,
Luke	And said unto them, Why sleep ye?
Luke	rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.
Luke	And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.
Luke	But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?
Luke	When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
Luke	And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
Luke	And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far.
Luke	And he touched his ear, and healed him.
Luke	Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?
Luke	When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.
Luke	Then took they him, and led [him], and brought him into the high priest’s house.
Luke	And Peter followed afar off.
Luke	And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.
Luke	But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.
Luke	And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
Luke	And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them.
Luke	And Peter said, Man, I am not.
Luke	And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this [fellow] also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.
Luke	And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest.
Luke	And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.
Luke	And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter.
Luke	And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
Luke	And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.
Luke	And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote [him].
Luke	And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?
Luke	And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.
Luke	And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,
Luke	Art thou the Christ?
Luke	tell us.
Luke	And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:
Luke	And if I also ask [you], ye will not answer me, nor let [me] go.
Luke	Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.
Luke	Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God?
Luke	And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.
Luke	And they said, What need we any further witness?
Luke	for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.
Luke	And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.
Luke	And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this [fellow] perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.
Luke	And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews?
Luke	And he answered him and said, Thou sayest [it].
Luke	Then said Pilate to the chief priests and [to] the people, I find no fault in this man.
Luke	And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.
Luke	When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.
Luke	And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.
Luke	And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long [season], because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.
Luke	Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
Luke	And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.
Luke	And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked [him], and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.
Luke	And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
Luke	And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
Luke	Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined [him] before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:
Luke	No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.
Luke	I will therefore chastise him, and release [him].
Luke	(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
Luke	And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this [man], and release unto us Barabbas:
Luke	(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)
Luke	Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.
Luke	But they cried, saying, Crucify [him], crucify him.
Luke	And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done?
Luke	I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let [him] go.
Luke	And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified.
Luke	And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.
Luke	And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
Luke	And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.
Luke	And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear [it] after Jesus.
Luke	And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.
Luke	But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.
Luke	For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed [are] the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.
Luke	Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
Luke	For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
Luke	And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
Luke	And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
Luke	Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.
Luke	And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.
Luke	And the people stood beholding.
Luke	And the rulers also with them derided [him], saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.
Luke	And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,
Luke	And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.
Luke	And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Luke	And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.
Luke	But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
Luke	And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
Luke	And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.
Luke	And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.
Luke	And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
Luke	And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
Luke	And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.
Luke	Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
Luke	And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.
Luke	And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.
Luke	And, behold, [there was] a man named Joseph, a counseller; [and he was] a good man, and a just:
Luke	(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) [he was] of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.
Luke	This [man] went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
Luke	And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.
Luke	And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
Luke	And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.
Luke	And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.
Luke	Now upon the first [day] of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain [others] with them.
Luke	And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
Luke	And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
Luke	And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:
Luke	And as they were afraid, and bowed down [their] faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
Luke	He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,
Luke	Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.
Luke	And they remembered his words,
Luke	And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.
Luke	It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary [the mother] of James, and other [women that were] with them, which told these things unto the apostles.
Luke	And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.
Luke	Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.
Luke	And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem [about] threescore furlongs.
Luke	And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
Luke	And it came to pass, that, while they communed [together] and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.
Luke	But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.
Luke	And he said unto them, What manner of communications [are] these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?
Luke	And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?
Luke	And he said unto them, What things?
Luke	And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:
Luke	And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.
Luke	But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.
Luke	Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;
Luke	And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.
Luke	And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found [it] even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.
Luke	Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:
Luke	Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?
Luke	And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
Luke	And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.
Luke	But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent.
Luke	And he went in to tarry with them.
Luke	And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed [it], and brake, and gave to them.
Luke	And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
Luke	And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?
Luke	And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,
Luke	Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
Luke	And they told what things [were done] in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.
Luke	And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you.
Luke	But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
Luke	And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled?
Luke	and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
Luke	Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.
Luke	And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them [his] hands and [his] feet.
Luke	And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?
Luke	And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.
Luke	And he took [it], and did eat before them.
Luke	And he said unto them, These [are] the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and [in] the prophets, and [in] the psalms, concerning me.
Luke	Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,
Luke	And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:
Luke	And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
Luke	And ye are witnesses of these things.
Luke	And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.
Luke	And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
Luke	And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.
Luke	And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:
Luke	And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.
Luke	Amen.
Luke	The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,
Luke	Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:
Luke	To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:
Luke	And, being assembled together with [them], commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, [saith he], ye have heard of me.
Luke	For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.
Luke	When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?
Luke	And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.
Luke	But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
Luke	And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.
Luke	And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;
Luke	Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?
Luke	this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.
Luke	Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day’s journey.
Luke	And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James [the son] of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas [the brother] of James.
Luke	These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.
Luke	And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)
Luke	Men [and] brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.
Luke	For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.
Luke	Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.
Luke	And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.
Luke	For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.
Luke	Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
Luke	Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.
Luke	And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
Luke	And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all [men], shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,
Luke	That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.
Luke	And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
Luke	And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.
Luke	And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
Luke	And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.
Luke	And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
Luke	And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.
Luke	Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.
Luke	And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?
Luke	And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?
Luke	Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,
Luke	Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,
Luke	Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.
Luke	And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?
Luke	Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.
Luke	But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all [ye] that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:
Luke	For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is [but] the third hour of the day.
Luke	But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;
Luke	And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:
Luke	And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:
Luke	And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:
Luke	The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:
Luke	And it shall come to pass, [that] whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
Luke	Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:
Luke	Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:
Luke	Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.
Luke	For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:
Luke	Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:
Luke	Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
Luke	Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.
Luke	Men [and] brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.
Luke	Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;
Luke	He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.
Luke	This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.
Luke	Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.
Luke	For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
Luke	Until I make thy foes thy footstool.
Luke	Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.
Luke	Now when they heard [this], they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men [and] brethren, what shall we do?
Luke	Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
Luke	For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, [even] as many as the Lord our God shall call.
Luke	And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.
Luke	Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added [unto them] about three thousand souls.
Luke	And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.
Luke	And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.
Luke	And all that believed were together, and had all things common;
Luke	And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all [men], as every man had need.
Luke	And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,
Luke	Praising God, and having favour with all the people.
Luke	And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.
Luke	Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, [being] the ninth [hour].
Luke	And a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;
Luke	Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.
Luke	And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.
Luke	And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.
Luke	Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.
Luke	And he took him by the right hand, and lifted [him] up: and immediately his feet and ancle bones received strength.
Luke	And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.
Luke	And all the people saw him walking and praising God:
Luke	And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.
Luke	And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly wondering.
Luke	And when Peter saw [it], he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this?
Luke	or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?
Luke	The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let [him] go.
Luke	But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;
Luke	And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.
Luke	And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
Luke	And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did [it], as [did] also your rulers.
Luke	But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.
Luke	Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;
Luke	And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:
Luke	Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.
Luke	For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.
Luke	And it shall come to pass, [that] every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.
Luke	Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.
Luke	Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.
Luke	Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.
Luke	And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,
Luke	Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
Luke	And they laid hands on them, and put [them] in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.
Luke	Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.
Luke	And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,
Luke	And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.
Luke	And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?
Luke	Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,
Luke	If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;
Luke	Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, [even] by him doth this man stand here before you whole.
Luke	This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.
Luke	Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
Luke	Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.
Luke	And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
Luke	But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
Luke	Saying, What shall we do to these men?
Luke	for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them [is] manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny [it].
Luke	But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.
Luke	And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
Luke	But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.
Luke	For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
Luke	So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all [men] glorified God for that which was done.
Luke	For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.
Luke	And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.
Luke	And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou [art] God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:
Luke	Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?
Luke	The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.
Luke	For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,
Luke	For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.
Luke	And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,
Luke	By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.
Luke	And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.
Luke	And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any [of them] that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.
Luke	And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.
Luke	Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,
Luke	And laid [them] down at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.
Luke	And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, [and] of the country of Cyprus,
Luke	Having land, sold [it], and brought the money, and laid [it] at the apostles’ feet.
Luke	But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,
Luke	And kept back [part] of the price, his wife also being privy [to it], and brought a certain part, and laid [it] at the apostles’ feet.
Luke	But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back [part] of the price of the land?
Luke	Whiles it remained, was it not thine own?
Luke	and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power?
Luke	why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart?
Luke	thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.
Luke	And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.
Luke	And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried [him] out, and buried [him].
Luke	And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.
Luke	And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much?
Luke	And she said, Yea, for so much.
Luke	Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord?
Luke	behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband [are] at the door, and shall carry thee out.
Luke	Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying [her] forth, buried [her] by her husband.
Luke	And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.
Luke	And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.
Luke	And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.
Luke	And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)
Luke	Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid [them] on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.
Luke	There came also a multitude [out] of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.
Luke	Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,
Luke	And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.
Luke	But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,
Luke	Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.
Luke	And when they heard [that], they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught.
Luke	But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
Luke	But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,
Luke	Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.
Luke	Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.
Luke	Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.
Luke	Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.
Luke	And when they had brought them, they set [them] before the council: and the high priest asked them,
Luke	Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name?
Luke	and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.
Luke	Then Peter and the [other] apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.
Luke	The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.
Luke	Him hath God exalted with his right hand [to be] a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.
Luke	And we are his witnesses of these things; and [so is] also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.
Luke	When they heard [that], they were cut [to the heart], and took counsel to slay them.
Luke	Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;
Luke	And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.
Luke	For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.
Luke	After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, [even] as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.
Luke	And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:
Luke	But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.
Luke	And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten [them], they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
Luke	And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.
Luke	And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.
Luke	And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.
Luke	Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples [unto them], and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.
Luke	Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
Luke	But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.
Luke	And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:
Luke	Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid [their] hands on them.
Luke	And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
Luke	And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.
Luke	Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called [the synagogue] of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.
Luke	And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.
Luke	Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and [against] God.
Luke	And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon [him], and caught him, and brought [him] to the council,
Luke	And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:
Luke	For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.
Luke	And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.
Luke	Then said the high priest, Are these things so?
Luke	And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,
Luke	And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.
Luke	Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.
Luke	And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not [so much as] to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when [as yet] he had no child.
Luke	And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat [them] evil four hundred years.
Luke	And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.
Luke	And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so [Abraham] begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac [begat] Jacob; and Jacob [begat] the twelve patriarchs.
Luke	And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,
Luke	And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.
Luke	Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.
Luke	But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.
Luke	And at the second [time] Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph’s kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.
Luke	Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to [him], and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.
Luke	So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,
Luke	And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor [the father] of Sychem.
Luke	But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
Luke	Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.
Luke	The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.
Luke	In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father’s house three months:
Luke	And when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.
Luke	And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.
Luke	And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.
Luke	And seeing one [of them] suffer wrong, he defended [him], and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:
Luke	For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.
Luke	And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?
Luke	But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?
Luke	Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?
Luke	Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.
Luke	And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.
Luke	When Moses saw [it], he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold [it], the voice of the Lord came unto him,
Luke	[Saying], I [am] the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
Luke	Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.
Luke	Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.
Luke	I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them.
Luke	And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.
Luke	This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge?
Luke	the same did God send [to be] a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.
Luke	He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.
Luke	This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.
Luke	This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and [with] our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:
Luke	To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust [him] from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,
Luke	Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for [as for] this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.
Luke	And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
Luke	Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices [by the space of] forty years in the wilderness?
Luke	Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
Luke	Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.
Luke	Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;
Luke	Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.
Luke	But Solomon built him an house.
Luke	Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,
Luke	Heaven [is] my throne, and earth [is] my footstool: what house will ye build me?
Luke	saith the Lord: or what [is] the place of my rest?
Luke	Hath not my hand made all these things?
Luke	Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers [did], so [do] ye.
Luke	Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted?
Luke	and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:
Luke	Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept [it].
Luke	When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with [their] teeth.
Luke	But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,
Luke	And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.
Luke	Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,
Luke	And cast [him] out of the city, and stoned [him]: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man’s feet, whose name was Saul.
Luke	And they stoned Stephen, calling upon [God], and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
Luke	And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.
Luke	And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
Luke	And Saul was consenting unto his death.
Luke	And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.
Luke	And devout men carried Stephen [to his burial], and made great lamentation over him.
Luke	As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed [them] to prison.
Luke	Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.
Luke	Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.
Luke	And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.
Luke	For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed [with them]: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.
Luke	And there was great joy in that city.
Luke	But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:
Luke	To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.
Luke	And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.
Luke	But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
Luke	Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.
Luke	Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:
Luke	Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:
Luke	(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)
Luke	Then laid they [their] hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.
Luke	And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,
Luke	Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.
Luke	But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
Luke	Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
Luke	Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.
Luke	For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and [in] the bond of iniquity.
Luke	Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.
Luke	And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
Luke	And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.
Luke	And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,
Luke	Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.
Luke	Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.
Luke	And Philip ran thither to [him], and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?
Luke	And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me?
Luke	And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.
Luke	The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:
Luke	In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation?
Luke	for his life is taken from the earth.
Luke	And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this?
Luke	of himself, or of some other man?
Luke	Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.
Luke	And as they went on [their] way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, [here is] water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?
Luke	And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest.
Luke	And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
Luke	And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
Luke	And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.
Luke	But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.
Luke	And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,
Luke	And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.
Luke	And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:
Luke	And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
Luke	And he said, Who art thou, Lord?
Luke	And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: [it is] hard for thee to kick against the pricks.
Luke	And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?
Luke	And the Lord [said] unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.
Luke	And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.
Luke	And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought [him] into Damascus.
Luke	And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.
Luke	And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias.
Luke	And he said, Behold, I [am here], Lord.
Luke	And the Lord [said] unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for [one] called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,
Luke	And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting [his] hand on him, that he might receive his sight.
Luke	Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:
Luke	And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.
Luke	But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:
Luke	For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name’s sake.
Luke	And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, [even] Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.
Luke	And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.
Luke	And when he had received meat, he was strengthened.
Luke	Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.
Luke	And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.
Luke	But all that heard [him] were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?
Luke	But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.
Luke	And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:
Luke	But their laying await was known of Saul.
Luke	And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.
Luke	Then the disciples took him by night, and let [him] down by the wall in a basket.
Luke	And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.
Luke	But Barnabas took him, and brought [him] to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.
Luke	And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.
Luke	And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.
Luke	[Which] when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.
Luke	Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.
Luke	And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all [quarters], he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.
Luke	And there he found a certain man named AEneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.
Luke	And Peter said unto him, AEneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed.
Luke	And he arose immediately.
Luke	And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.
Luke	Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.
Luke	And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid [her] in an upper chamber.
Luke	And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring [him] that he would not delay to come to them.
Luke	Then Peter arose and went with them.
Luke	When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.
Luke	But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning [him] to the body said, Tabitha, arise.
Luke	And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
Luke	And he gave her [his] hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.
Luke	And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.
Luke	And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.
Luke	There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian [band],
Luke	[A] devout [man], and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.
Luke	He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.
Luke	And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord?
Luke	And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.
Luke	And now send men to Joppa, and call for [one] Simon, whose surname is Peter:
Luke	He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.
Luke	And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;
Luke	And when he had declared all [these] things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.
Luke	On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:
Luke	And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,
Luke	And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:
Luke	Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.
Luke	And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.
Luke	But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.
Luke	And the voice [spake] unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, [that] call not thou common.
Luke	This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.
Luke	Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate,
Luke	And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.
Luke	While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.
Luke	Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.
Luke	Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what [is] the cause wherefore ye are come?
Luke	And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.
Luke	Then called he them in, and lodged [them].
Luke	And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
Luke	And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea.
Luke	And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.
Luke	And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped [him].
Luke	But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.
Luke	And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.
Luke	And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.
Luke	Therefore came I [unto you] without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?
Luke	And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
Luke	And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.
Luke	Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of [one] Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.
Luke	Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come.
Luke	Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.
Luke	Then Peter opened [his] mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:
Luke	But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.
Luke	The word which [God] sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)
Luke	That word, [I say], ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;
Luke	How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.
Luke	And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:
Luke	Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;
Luke	Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, [even] to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.
Luke	And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God [to be] the Judge of quick and dead.
Luke	To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.
Luke	While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.
Luke	And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.
Luke	For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God.
Luke	Then answered Peter,
Luke	Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?
Luke	And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.
Luke	Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.
Luke	And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.
Luke	And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,
Luke	Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.
Luke	But Peter rehearsed [the matter] from the beginning, and expounded [it] by order unto them, saying,
Luke	I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:
Luke	Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.
Luke	And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.
Luke	But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.
Luke	But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, [that] call not thou common.
Luke	And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.
Luke	And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.
Luke	And the spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting.
Luke	Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man’s house:
Luke	And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;
Luke	Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved.
Luke	And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.
Luke	Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.
Luke	Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as [he did] unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?
Luke	When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.
Luke	Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.
Luke	And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.
Luke	And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.
Luke	Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.
Luke	Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.
Luke	For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.
Luke	Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:
Luke	And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch.
Luke	And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people.
Luke	And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.
Luke	And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.
Luke	And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.
Luke	Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:
Luke	Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
Luke	Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth [his] hands to vex certain of the church.
Luke	And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
Luke	And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also.
Luke	(Then were the days of unleavened bread.)
Luke	And when he had apprehended him, he put [him] in prison, and delivered [him] to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.
Luke	Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.
Luke	And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.
Luke	And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon [him], and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly.
Luke	And his chains fell off from [his] hands.
Luke	And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals.
Luke	And so he did.
Luke	And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.
Luke	And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.
Luke	When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.
Luke	And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and [from] all the expectation of the people of the Jews.
Luke	And when he had considered [the thing], he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.
Luke	And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.
Luke	And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.
Luke	And they said unto her, Thou art mad.
Luke	But she constantly affirmed that it was even so.
Luke	Then said they, It is his angel.
Luke	But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened [the door], and saw him, they were astonished.
Luke	But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison.
Luke	And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren.
Luke	And he departed, and went into another place.
Luke	Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.
Luke	And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that [they] should be put to death.
Luke	And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and [there] abode.
Luke	And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king’s chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king’s [country].
Luke	And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.
Luke	And the people gave a shout, [saying, It is] the voice of a god, and not of a man.
Luke	And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.
Luke	But the word of God grew and multiplied.
Luke	And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled [their] ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.
Luke	Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
Luke	As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.
Luke	And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid [their] hands on them, they sent [them] away.
Luke	So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.
Luke	And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to [their] minister.
Luke	And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name [was] Barjesus:
Luke	Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.
Luke	But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.
Luke	Then Saul, (who also [is called] Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,
Luke	And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
Luke	And now, behold, the hand of the Lord [is] upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season.
Luke	And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.
Luke	Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.
Luke	Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.
Luke	But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.
Luke	And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, [Ye] men [and] brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.
Luke	Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with [his] hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.
Luke	The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.
Luke	And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.
Luke	And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.
Luke	And after that he gave [unto them] judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.
Luke	And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.
Luke	And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the [son] of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.
Luke	Of this man’s seed hath God according to [his] promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:
Luke	When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
Luke	And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am?
Luke	I am not [he].
Luke	But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of [his] feet I am not worthy to loose.
Luke	Men [and] brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.
Luke	For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled [them] in condemning [him].
Luke	And though they found no cause of death [in him], yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.
Luke	And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took [him] down from the tree, and laid [him] in a sepulchre.
Luke	But God raised him from the dead:
Luke	And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.
Luke	And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,
Luke	God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.
Luke	And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, [now] no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.
Luke	Wherefore he saith also in another [psalm], Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
Luke	For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:
Luke	But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.
Luke	Be it known unto you therefore, men [and] brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:
Luke	And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.
Luke	Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;
Luke	Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.
Luke	And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.
Luke	Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.
Luke	And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.
Luke	But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.
Luke	Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.
Luke	For so hath the Lord commanded us, [saying], I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.
Luke	And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.
Luke	And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.
Luke	But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.
Luke	But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.
Luke	And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.
Luke	And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.
Luke	But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren.
Luke	Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
Luke	But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.
Luke	And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use [them] despitefully, and to stone them,
Luke	They were ware of [it], and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:
Luke	And there they preached the gospel.
Luke	And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother’s womb, who never had walked:
Luke	The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,
Luke	Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet.
Luke	And he leaped and walked.
Luke	And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.
Luke	And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.
Luke	Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.
Luke	[Which] when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard [of], they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,
Luke	And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things?
Luke	We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:
Luke	Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.
Luke	Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.
Luke	And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them.
Luke	And there came thither [certain] Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew [him] out of the city, supposing he had been dead.
Luke	Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
Luke	And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and [to] Iconium, and Antioch,
Luke	Confirming the souls of the disciples, [and] exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.
Luke	And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.
Luke	And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
Luke	And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:
Luke	And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.
Luke	And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.
Luke	And there they abode long time with the disciples.
Luke	And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, [and said], Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.
Luke	When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.
Luke	And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.
Luke	And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and [of] the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.
Luke	But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command [them] to keep the law of Moses.
Luke	And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.
Luke	And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men [and] brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.
Luke	And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as [he did] unto us;
Luke	And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
Luke	Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
Luke	But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.
Luke	Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.
Luke	And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men [and] brethren, hearken unto me:
Luke	Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.
Luke	And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
Luke	After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:
Luke	That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.
Luke	Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.
Luke	Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:
Luke	But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and [from] fornication, and [from] things strangled, and [from] blood.
Luke	For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.
Luke	Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; [namely], Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:
Luke	And they wrote [letters] by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren [send] greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:
Luke	Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, [Ye must] be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no [such] commandment:
Luke	It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
Luke	Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Luke	We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell [you] the same things by mouth.
Luke	For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;
Luke	That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well.
Luke	Fare ye well.
Luke	So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:
Luke	[Which] when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.
Luke	And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed [them].
Luke	And after they had tarried [there] a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.
Luke	Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.
Luke	Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.
Luke	And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, [and see] how they do.
Luke	And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.
Luke	But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.
Luke	And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;
Luke	And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.
Luke	And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
Luke	Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father [was] a Greek:
Luke	Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.
Luke	Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.
John	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
John	The same was in the beginning with God.
John	All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
John	In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
John	And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.
John	There was a man sent from God, whose name [was] John.
John	The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all [men] through him might believe.
John	He was not that Light, but [was sent] to bear witness of that Light.
John	[That] was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.
John	He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
John	He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
John	But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name:
John	Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
John	And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
John	John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.
John	And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.
John	For the law was given by Moses, [but] grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
John	No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared [him].
John	And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?
John	And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.
John	And they asked him, What then?
John	Art thou Elias?
John	And he saith, I am not.
John	Art thou that prophet?
John	And he answered, No.
John	Then said they unto him, Who art thou?
John	that we may give an answer to them that sent us.
John	What sayest thou of thyself?
John	He said, I [am] the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.
John	And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.
John	And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?
John	John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;
John	He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.
John	These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.
John	The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.
John	This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.
John	And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.
John	And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.
John	And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.
John	And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.
John	Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;
John	And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!
John	And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
John	Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye?
John	They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?
John	He saith unto them, Come and see.
John	They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.
John	One of the two which heard John [speak], and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.
John	He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.
John	And he brought him to Jesus.
John	And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.
John	The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.
John	Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
John	Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
John	And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?
John	Philip saith unto him, Come and see.
John	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!
John	Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me?
John	Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.
John	Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.
John	Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou?
John	thou shalt see greater things than these.
John	And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
John	And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:
John	And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.
John	And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.
John	Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee?
John	mine hour is not yet come.
John	His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do [it].
John	And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.
John	Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water.
John	And they filled them up to the brim.
John	And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast.
John	And they bare [it].
John	When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
John	And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: [but] thou hast kept the good wine until now.
John	This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
John	After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.
John	And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,
John	And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:
John	And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables;
John	And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.
John	And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.
John	Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?
John	Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
John	Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?
John	But he spake of the temple of his body.
John	When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
John	Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast [day], many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.
John	But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all [men],
John	And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.
John	There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
John	The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.
John	Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
John	Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old?
John	can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?
John	Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and [of] the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
John	That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
John	Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
John	The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
John	Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
John	Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?
John	Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.
John	If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you [of] heavenly things?
John	And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, [even] the Son of man which is in heaven.
John	And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:
John	That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
John	For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
John	For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
John	He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
John	And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
John	For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
John	But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.
John	After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.
John	And John also was baptizing in AEnon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
John	For John was not yet cast into prison.
John	Then there arose a question between [some] of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.
John	And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all [men] come to him.
John	John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.
John	Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
John	He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.
John	He must increase, but I [must] decrease.
John	He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.
John	And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.
John	He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.
John	For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure [unto him].
John	The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.
John	He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.
John	When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,
John	(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)
John	He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.
John	And he must needs go through Samaria.
John	Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
John	Now Jacob’s well was there.
John	Jesus therefore, being wearied with [his] journey, sat thus on the well: [and] it was about the sixth hour.
John	There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.
John	(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)
John	Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria?
John	for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.
John	Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.
John	The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?
John	Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?
John	Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:
John	But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
John	The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.
John	Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
John	The woman answered and said, I have no husband.
John	Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:
John	For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.
John	The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
John	Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
John	Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.
John	Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.
John	But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.
John	God [is] a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship [him] in spirit and in truth.
John	The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.
John	Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am [he].
John	And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou?
John	or, Why talkest thou with her?
John	The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,
John	Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?
John	Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
John	In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
John	But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.
John	Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him [ought] to eat?
John	Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
John	Say not ye, There are yet four months, and [then] cometh harvest?
John	behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.
John	And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.
John	And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
John	I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.
John	And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.
John	So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.
John	And many more believed because of his own word;
John	And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard [him] ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.
John	Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
John	For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.
John	Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.
John	So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine.
John	And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
John	When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.
John	Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.
John	The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
John	Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth.
John	And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.
John	And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told [him], saying, Thy son liveth.
John	Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend.
John	And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
John	So the father knew that [it was] at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.
John	This [is] again the second miracle [that] Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.
John	After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
John	Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep [market] a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.
John	In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
John	For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.
John	And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
John	When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time [in that case], he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?
John	The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.
John	Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
John	And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.
John	The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry [thy] bed.
John	He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.
John	Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?
John	And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in [that] place.
John	Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.
John	The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.
John	And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.
John	But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.
John	Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.
John	Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.
John	For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.
John	For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth [them]; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.
John	For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:
John	That all [men] should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.
John	He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.
John	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.
John	Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.
John	For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;
John	And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.
John	Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
John	And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.
John	I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.
John	If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
John	There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.
John	Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.
John	But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.
John	He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.
John	But I have greater witness than [that] of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.
John	And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me.
John	Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.
John	And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.
John	Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.
John	And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.
John	I receive not honour from men.
John	But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.
John	I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.
John	How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that [cometh] from God only?
John	Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is [one] that accuseth you, [even] Moses, in whom ye trust.
John	For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.
John	But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?
John	After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is [the sea] of Tiberias.
John	And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.
John	And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.
John	And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.
John	When Jesus then lifted up [his] eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?
John	And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.
John	Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.
John	One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto him,
John	There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?
John	And Jesus said, Make the men sit down.
John	Now there was much grass in the place.
John	So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
John	And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.
John	When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.
John	Therefore they gathered [them] together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.
John	Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.
John	When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.
John	And when even was [now] come, his disciples went down unto the sea,
John	And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum.
John	And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.
John	And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.
John	So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.
John	But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.
John	Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.
John	The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but [that] his disciples were gone away alone;
John	(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)
John	When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.
John	And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?
John	Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.
John	Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.
John	Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?
John	Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.
John	They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee?
John	what dost thou work?
John	Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
John	Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.
John	For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.
John	Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
John	And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.
John	But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.
John	All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.
John	For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.
John	And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.
John	And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.
John	The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.
John	And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?
John	how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?
John	Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.
John	No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.
John	It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God.
John	Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.
John	Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.
John	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.
John	I am that bread of life.
John	Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.
John	This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.
John	I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
John	The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us [his] flesh to eat?
John	Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.
John	Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
John	For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
John	He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.
John	As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.
John	This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.
John	These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
John	Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard [this], said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?
John	When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?
John	[What] and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?
John	It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, [they] are spirit, and [they] are life.
John	But there are some of you that believe not.
John	For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.
John	And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.
John	From that [time] many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.
John	Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?
John	Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go?
John	thou hast the words of eternal life.
John	And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.
John	Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
John	He spake of Judas Iscariot [the son] of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.
John	After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.
John	Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand.
John	His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.
John	For [there is] no man [that] doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly.
John	If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.
John	For neither did his brethren believe in him.
John	Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.
John	The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.
John	Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.
John	When he had said these words unto them, he abode [still] in Galilee.
John	But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.
John	Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
John	And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.
John	Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
John	Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
John	And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?
John	Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.
John	If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or [whether] I speak of myself.
John	He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
John	Did not Moses give you the law, and [yet] none of you keepeth the law?
John	Why go ye about to kill me?
John	The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?
John	Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.
John	Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.
John	If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?
John	Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
John	Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?
John	But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him.
John	Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?
John	Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
John	Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
John	But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
John	Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
John	And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this [man] hath done?
John	The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.
John	Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and [then] I go unto him that sent me.
John	Ye shall seek me, and shall not find [me]: and where I am, [thither] ye cannot come.
John	Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him?
John	will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
John	What [manner of] saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find [me]: and where I am, [thither] ye cannot come?
John	In the last day, that great [day] of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.
John	He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
John	(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet [given]; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)
John	Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.
John	Others said, This is the Christ.
John	But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?
John	Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?
John	So there was a division among the people because of him.
John	And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
John	Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?
John	The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.
John	Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?
John	Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
John	But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.
John	Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)
John	Doth our law judge [any] man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?
John	They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee?
John	Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
John	And every man went unto his own house.
John	Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
John	And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.
John	And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,
John	They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.
John	Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?
John	This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him.
John	But Jesus stooped down, and with [his] finger wrote on the ground, [as though he heard them not].
John	So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
John	And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
John	And they which heard [it], being convicted by [their own] conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, [even] unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
John	When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers?
John	hath no man condemned thee?
John	She said, No man, Lord.
John	And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.
John	Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
John	The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.
John	Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, [yet] my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.
John	Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
John	And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
John	It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.
John	I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.
John	Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father?
John	Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.
John	These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.
John	Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.
John	Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself?
John	because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.
John	And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.
John	I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins.
John	Then said they unto him, Who art thou?
John	And Jesus saith unto them, Even [the same] that I said unto you from the beginning.
John	I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.
John	They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.
John	Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am [he], and [that] I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.
John	And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.
John	As he spake these words, many believed on him.
John	Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, [then] are ye my disciples indeed;
John	And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
John	They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?
John	Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.
John	And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: [but] the Son abideth ever.
John	If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
John	I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.
John	I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.
John	They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father.
John	Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.
John	But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.
John	Ye do the deeds of your father.
John	Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.
John	Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.
John	Why do ye not understand my speech?
John	[even] because ye cannot hear my word.
John	Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do.
John	He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.
John	When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.
John	And because I tell [you] the truth, ye believe me not.
John	Which of you convinceth me of sin?
John	And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?
John	He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear [them] not, because ye are not of God.
John	Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?
John	Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.
John	And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.
John	Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.
John	Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil.
John	Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.
John	Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead?
John	and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?
John	Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:
John	Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.
John	Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw [it], and was glad.
John	Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
John	Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.
John	Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.
John	And as [Jesus] passed by, he saw a man which was blind from [his] birth.
John	And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
John	Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
John	I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
John	As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
John	When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
John	And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
John	The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?
John	Some said, This is he: others [said], He is like him: [but] he said, I am [he].
John	Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?
John	He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.
John	Then said they unto him, Where is he?
John	He said, I know not.
John	They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
John	And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
John	Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight.
John	He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.
John	Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day.
John	Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles?
John	And there was a division among them.
John	They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes?
John	He said, He is a prophet.
John	But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.
John	And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind?
John	how then doth he now see?
John	His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
John	But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.
John	These [words] spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
John	Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
John	Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.
John	He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner [or no], I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
John	Then said they to him again, What did he to thee?
John	how opened he thine eyes?
John	He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear [it] again?
John	will ye also be his disciples?
John	Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples.
John	We know that God spake unto Moses: [as for] this [fellow], we know not from whence he is.
John	The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and [yet] he hath opened mine eyes.
John	Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.
John	Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.
John	If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
John	They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us?
John	And they cast him out.
John	Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?
John	He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?
John	And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.
John	And he said, Lord, I believe.
John	And he worshipped him.
John	And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.
John	And [some] of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?
John	Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.
John	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
John	But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
John	To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.
John	And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
John	And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
John	This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.
John	Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.
John	All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
John	I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
John	The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have [it] more abundantly.
John	I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.
John	But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.
John	The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.
John	I am the good shepherd, and know my [sheep], and am known of mine.
John	As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.
John	And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, [and] one shepherd.
John	Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.
John	No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself.
John	I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.
John	This commandment have I received of my Father.
John	There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.
John	And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?
John	Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil.
John	Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?
John	And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.
John	And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.
John	Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt?
John	If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.
John	Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me.
John	But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.
John	My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
John	And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any [man] pluck them out of my hand.
John	My Father, which gave [them] me, is greater than all; and no [man] is able to pluck [them] out of my Father’s hand.
John	I and [my] Father are one.
John	Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
John	Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
John	The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.
John	Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?
John	If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;
John	Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?
John	If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
John	But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father [is] in me, and I in him.
John	Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,
John	And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.
John	And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.
John	And many believed on him there.
John	Now a certain [man] was sick, [named] Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.
John	(It was [that] Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
John	Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
John	When Jesus heard [that], he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.
John	Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
John	When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.
John	Then after that saith he to [his] disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.
John	[His] disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?
John	Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day?
John	If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.
John	But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.
John	These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.
John	Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.
John	Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
John	Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
John	And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.
John	Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
John	Then when Jesus came, he found that he had [lain] in the grave four days already.
John	Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:
John	And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
John	Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat [still] in the house.
John	Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
John	But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give [it] thee.
John	Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
John	Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
John	Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
John	And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
John	Believest thou this?
John	She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.
John	And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.
John	As soon as she heard [that], she arose quickly, and came unto him.
John	Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.
John	The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.
John	Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
John	When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,
John	And said, Where have ye laid him?
John	They said unto him, Lord, come and see.
John	Jesus wept.
John	Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!
John	And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?
John	Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave.
John	It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.
John	Jesus said, Take ye away the stone.
John	Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been [dead] four days.
John	Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
John	Then they took away the stone [from the place] where the dead was laid.
John	And Jesus lifted up [his] eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.
John	And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said [it], that they may believe that thou hast sent me.
John	And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.
John	And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin.
John	Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.
John	Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.
John	But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.
John	Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we?
John	for this man doeth many miracles.
John	If we let him thus alone, all [men] will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.
John	And one of them, [named] Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,
John	Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
John	And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;
John	And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.
John	Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.
John	Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.
John	And the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.
John	Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?
John	Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew [it], that they might take him.
John	Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.
John	There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.
John	Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
John	Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s [son], which should betray him,
John	Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?
John	This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.
John	Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.
John	For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.
John	Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
John	But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;
John	Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
John	On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
John	Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed [is] the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.
John	And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,
John	Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.
John	These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and [that] they had done these things unto him.
John	The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.
John	For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.
John	The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing?
John	behold, the world is gone after him.
John	And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:
John	The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.
John	Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.
John	And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
John	Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.
John	He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
John	If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will [my] Father honour.
John	Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?
John	Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.
John	Father, glorify thy name.
John	Then came there a voice from heaven, [saying], I have both glorified [it], and will glorify [it] again.
John	The people therefore, that stood by, and heard [it], said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.
John	Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.
John	Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
John	And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all [men] unto me.
John	This he said, signifying what death he should die.
John	The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up?
John	who is this Son of man?
John	Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you.
John	Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.
John	While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.
John	These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.
John	But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:
John	That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report?
John	and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
John	Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,
John	He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with [their] eyes, nor understand with [their] heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
John	These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.
John	Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess [him], lest they should be put out of the synagogue:
John	For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
John	Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.
John	And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.
John	I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.
John	And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
John	He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.
John	For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
John	And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.
John	Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.
John	And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s [son], to betray him;
John	Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;
John	He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.
John	After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe [them] with the towel wherewith he was girded.
John	Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
John	Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.
John	Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet.
John	Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.
John	Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also [my] hands and [my] head.
John	Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash [his] feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.
John	For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.
John	So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?
John	Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for [so] I am.
John	If I then, [your] Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another’s feet.
John	For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.
John	Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.
John	If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.
John	I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.
John	Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am [he].
John	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
John	When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
John	Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.
John	Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
John	Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.
John	He then lying on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?
John	Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped [it].
John	And when he had dipped the sop, he gave [it] to Judas Iscariot, [the son] of Simon.
John	And after the sop Satan entered into him.
John	Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.
John	Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.
John	For some [of them] thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy [those things] that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
John	He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.
John	Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
John	If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.
John	Little children, yet a little while I am with you.
John	Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.
John	A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.
John	By this shall all [men] know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.
John	Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou?
John	Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.
John	Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now?
John	I will lay down my life for thy sake.
John	Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?
John	Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.
John	Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.
John	In my Father’s house are many mansions: if [it were] not [so], I would have told you.
John	I go to prepare a place for you.
John	And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, [there] ye may be also.
John	And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.
John	Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?
John	Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
John	If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.
John	Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.
John	Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?
John	he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou [then], Shew us the Father?
John	Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?
John	the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.
John	Believe me that I [am] in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake.
John	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater [works] than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.
John	And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
John	If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do [it].
John	If ye love me, keep my commandments.
John	And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;
John	[Even] the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.
John	I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.
John	Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.
John	At that day ye shall know that I [am] in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
John	He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
John	Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?
John	Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.
John	He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s which sent me.
John	These things have I spoken unto you, being [yet] present with you.
John	But the Comforter, [which is] the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.
John	Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.
John	Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
John	Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come [again] unto you.
John	If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.
John	And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.
John	Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.
John	But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do.
John	Arise, let us go hence.
John	I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
John	Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every [branch] that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.
John	Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
John	Abide in me, and I in you.
John	As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.
John	I am the vine, ye [are] the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.
John	If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast [them] into the fire, and they are burned.
John	If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.
John	Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.
John	As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.
John	If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.
John	These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and [that] your joy might be full.
John	This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.
John	Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
John	Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.
John	Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.
John	Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and [that] your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.
John	These things I command you, that ye love one another.
John	If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before [it hated] you.
John	If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.
John	Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord.
John	If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.
John	But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.
John	If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin.
John	He that hateth me hateth my Father also.
John	If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.
John	But [this cometh to pass], that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.
John	But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, [even] the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:
John	And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.
John	These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.
John	They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.
John	And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.
John	But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them.
John	And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.
John	But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?
John	But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.
John	Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.
John	And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:
John	Of sin, because they believe not on me;
John	Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;
John	Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.
John	I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.
John	Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, [that] shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.
John	He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew [it] unto you.
John	All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew [it] unto you.
John	A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.
John	Then said [some] of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?
John	They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while?
John	we cannot tell what he saith.
John	Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?
John	Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
John	A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.
John	And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.
John	And in that day ye shall ask me nothing.
John	Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give [it] you.
John	Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.
John	These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.
John	At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:
John	For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.
John	I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.
John	His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.
John	Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.
John	Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?
John	Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
John	These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace.
John	In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
John	These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:
John	As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.
John	And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.
John	I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.
John	And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.
John	I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.
John	Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.
John	For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received [them], and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.
John	I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.
John	And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.
John	And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee.
John	Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we [are].
John	While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.
John	And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
John	I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
John	I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.
John	They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
John	Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.
John	As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.
John	And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.
John	Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;
John	That they all may be one; as thou, Father, [art] in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.
John	And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:
John	I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.
John	Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.
John	O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.
John	And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare [it]: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.
John	When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.
John	And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.
John	Judas then, having received a band [of men] and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.
John	Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?
John	They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth.
John	Jesus saith unto them, I am [he].
John	And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.
John	As soon then as he had said unto them, I am [he], they went backward, and fell to the ground.
John	Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye?
John	And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.
John	Jesus answered, I have told you that I am [he]: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:
John	That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.
John	Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear.
John	The servant’s name was Malchus.
John	Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?
John	Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,
John	And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.
John	Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
John	And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and [so did] another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.
John	But Peter stood at the door without.
John	Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.
John	Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also [one] of this man’s disciples?
John	He saith, I am not.
John	And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.
John	The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.
John	Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.
John	Why askest thou me?
John	ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.
John	And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?
John	Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?
John	Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.
John	And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself.
John	They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also [one] of his disciples?
John	He denied [it], and said, I am not.
John	One of the servants of the high priest, being [his] kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?
John	Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.
John	Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.
John	Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?
John	They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.
John	Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law.
John	The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:
John	That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.
John	Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
John	Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?
John	Pilate answered, Am I a Jew?
John	Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?
John	Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.
John	Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then?
John	Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king.
John	To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.
John	Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.
John	Pilate saith unto him, What is truth?
John	And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault [at all].
John	But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
John	Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas.
John	Now Barabbas was a robber.
John	Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged [him].
John	And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put [it] on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,
John	And said, Hail, King of the Jews!
John	and they smote him with their hands.
John	Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.
John	Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe.
John	And [Pilate] saith unto them, Behold the man!
John	When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify [him], crucify [him].
John	Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify [him]: for I find no fault in him.
John	The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
John	When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;
John	And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou?
John	But Jesus gave him no answer.
John	Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me?
John	knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?
John	Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power [at all] against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.
John	And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar’s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.
John	When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.
John	And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!
John	But they cried out, Away with [him], away with [him], crucify him.
John	Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King?
John	The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
John	Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified.
John	And they took Jesus, and led [him] away.
John	And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called [the place] of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:
John	Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.
John	And Pilate wrote a title, and put [it] on the cross.
John	And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.
John	This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, [and] Greek, [and] Latin.
John	Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.
John	Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
John	Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also [his] coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
John	They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots.
John	These things therefore the soldiers did.
John	Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the [wife] of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
John	When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
John	Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother!
John	And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own [home].
John	After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.
John	Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put [it] upon hyssop, and put [it] to his mouth.
John	When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.
John	The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and [that] they might be taken away.
John	Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.
John	But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:
John	But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.
John	And he that saw [it] bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.
John	For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.
John	And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.
John	And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave [him] leave.
John	He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.
John	And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound [weight].
John	Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.
John	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.
John	There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews’ preparation [day]; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.
John	The first [day] of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.
John	Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.
John	Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.
John	So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.
John	And he stooping down, [and looking in], saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.
John	Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,
John	And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.
John	Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.
John	For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.
John	Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.
John	But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, [and looked] into the sepulchre,
John	And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
John	And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou?
John	She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.
John	And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
John	Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou?
John	whom seekest thou?
John	She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
John	Jesus saith unto her, Mary.
John	She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.
John	Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and [to] my God, and your God.
John	Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and [that] he had spoken these things unto her.
John	Then the same day at evening, being the first [day] of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you.
John	And when he had so said, he shewed unto them [his] hands and his side.
John	Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.
John	Then said Jesus to them again, Peace [be] unto you: as [my] Father hath sent me, even so send I you.
John	And when he had said this, he breathed on [them], and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:
John	Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; [and] whose soever [sins] ye retain, they are retained.
John	But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
John	The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord.
John	But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.
John	And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: [then] came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace [be] unto you.
John	Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust [it] into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.
John	And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.
John	Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed [are] they that have not seen, and [yet] have believed.
John	And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:
John	But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.
John	After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he [himself].
John	There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the [sons] of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.
John	Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing.
John	They say unto him, We also go with thee.
John	They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.
John	But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
John	Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat?
John	They answered him, No.
John	And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find.
John	They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
John	Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord.
John	Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt [his] fisher’s coat [unto him], (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.
John	And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.
John	As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
John	Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.
John	Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.
John	Jesus saith unto them, Come [and] dine.
John	And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou?
John	knowing that it was the Lord.
John	Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.
John	This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.
John	So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?
John	He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee.
John	He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.
John	He saith to him again the second time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me?
John	He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee.
John	He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
John	He saith unto him the third time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me?
John	Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me?
John	And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee.
John	Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
John	Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry [thee] whither thou wouldest not.
John	This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God.
John	And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.
John	Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?
John	Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what [shall] this man [do]?
John	Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what [is that] to thee?
John	follow thou me.
John	Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what [is that] to thee?
John	This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.
John	And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.
John	Amen.
John	That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;
John	(For the life was manifested, and we have seen [it], and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)
John	That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship [is] with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
John	And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.
John	This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
John	If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:
John	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
John	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
John	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us [our] sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
John	If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
John	My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not.
John	And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:
John	And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for [the sins of] the whole world.
John	And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
John	He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
John	But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.
John	He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.
John	Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning.
John	The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.
John	Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.
John	He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.
John	He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.
John	But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.
John	I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.
John	I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him [that is] from the beginning.
John	I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one.
John	I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.
John	I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him [that is] from the beginning.
John	I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.
John	Love not the world, neither the things [that are] in the world.
John	If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
John	For all that [is] in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
John	And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
John	Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.
John	They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would [no doubt] have continued with us: but [they went out], that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.
John	But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.
John	I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.
John	Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ?
John	He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.
John	Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: [(but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also].
John	Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning.
John	If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.
John	And this is the promise that he hath promised us, [even] eternal life.
John	These [things] have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.
John	But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.
John	And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.
John	If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.
John	Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.
John	Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.
John	And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
John	Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.
John	And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.
John	Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.
John	Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
John	He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning.
John	For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
John	Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.
John	In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.
John	For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.
John	Not as Cain, [who] was of that wicked one, and slew his brother.
John	And wherefore slew he him?
John	Because his own works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.
John	Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.
John	We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren.
John	He that loveth not [his] brother abideth in death.
John	Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
John	Hereby perceive we the love [of God], because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down [our] lives for the brethren.
John	But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels [of compassion] from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?
John	My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.
John	And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.
John	For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.
John	Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, [then] have we confidence toward God.
John	And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.
John	And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.
John	And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him.
John	And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.
John	Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
John	Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:
John	And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that [spirit] of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.
John	Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.
John	They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.
John	We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us.
John	Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
John	Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.
John	He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
John	In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.
John	Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son [to be] the propitiation for our sins.
John	Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
John	No man hath seen God at any time.
John	If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.
John	Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.
John	And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son [to be] the Saviour of the world.
John	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.
John	And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us.
John	God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.
John	Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.
John	There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment.
John	He that feareth is not made perfect in love.
John	We love him, because he first loved us.
John	If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?
John	And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.
John	Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.
John	By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.
John	For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.
John	For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, [even] our faith.
John	Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?
John	This is he that came by water and blood, [even] Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood.
John	And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.
John	For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.
John	And there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.
John	If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.
John	He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.
John	And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
John	He that hath the Son hath life; [and] he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.
John	These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
John	And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:
John	And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.
John	If any man see his brother sin a sin [which is] not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death.
John	There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.
John	All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.
John	We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.
John	[And] we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.
John	And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, [even] in his Son Jesus Christ.
John	This is the true God, and eternal life.
John	Little children, keep yourselves from idols.
John	Amen.
John	The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;
John	For the truth’s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.
John	Grace be with you, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
John	I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.
John	And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.
John	And this is love, that we walk after his commandments.
John	This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.
John	For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.
John	This is a deceiver and an antichrist.
John	Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.
John	Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God.
John	He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.
John	If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into [your] house, neither bid him God speed:
John	For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.
John	Having many things to write unto you, I would not [write] with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.
John	The children of thy elect sister greet thee.
John	Amen.
John	The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
John	Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.
John	For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.
John	I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.
John	Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;
John	Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:
John	Because that for his name’s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.
John	We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.
John	I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.
John	Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth [them] out of the church.
John	Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good.
John	He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.
John	Demetrius hath good report of all [men], and of the truth itself: yea, and we [also] bear record; and ye know that our record is true.
John	I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:
John	But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face.
John	Peace [be] to thee.
John	[Our] friends salute thee.
John	Greet the friends by name.
John	The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified [it] by his angel unto his servant John:
John	Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.
John	Blessed [is] he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time [is] at hand.
John	John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;
John	And from Jesus Christ, [who is] the faithful witness, [and] the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.
John	Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,
John	And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him [be] glory and dominion for ever and ever.
John	Amen.
John	Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they [also] which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him.
John	Even so, Amen.
John	I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.
John	I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.
John	I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,
John	Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send [it] unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.
John	And I turned to see the voice that spake with me.
John	And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;
John	And in the midst of the seven candlesticks [one] like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.
John	His head and [his] hairs [were] white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes [were] as a flame of fire;
John	And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.
John	And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance [was] as the sun shineth in his strength.
John	And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead.
John	And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:
John	[I am] he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.
John	Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;
John	The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks.
John	The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.
John	Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;
John	I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:
John	And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name’s sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.
John	Nevertheless I have [somewhat] against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.
John	Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.
John	But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
John	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.
John	And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;
John	I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and [I know] the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but [are] the synagogue of Satan.
John	Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast [some] of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.
John	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.
John	And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;
John	I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, [even] where Satan’s seat [is]: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas [was] my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.
John	But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.
John	So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.
John	Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
John	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth [it].
John	And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet [are] like fine brass;
John	I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last [to be] more than the first.
John	Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.
John	And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.
John	Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.
John	And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.
John	But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.
John	But that which ye have [already] hold fast till I come.
John	And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:
John	And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.
John	And I will give him the morning star.
John	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
John	And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.
John	Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.
John	Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent.
John	If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.
John	Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.
John	He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.
John	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
John	And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;
John	I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.
John	Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.
John	Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.
John	Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.
John	Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, [which is] new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and [I will write upon him] my new name.
John	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
John	And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;
John	I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.
John	So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.
John	Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:
John	I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and [that] the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.
John	As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.
John	Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.
John	To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.
John	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
John	After this I looked, and, behold, a door [was] opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard [was] as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.
John	And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and [one] sat on the throne.
John	And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and [there was] a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.
John	And round about the throne [were] four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.
John	And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and [there were] seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.
John	And before the throne [there was] a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, [were] four beasts full of eyes before and behind.
John	And the first beast [was] like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast [was] like a flying eagle.
John	And the four beasts had each of them six wings about [him]; and [they were] full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.
John	And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,
John	The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
John	Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.
John	And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.
John	And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?
John	And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.
John	And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.
John	And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.
John	And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.
John	And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.
John	And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four [and] twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.
John	And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;
John	And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.
John	And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;
John	Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.
John	And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, [be] unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.
John	And the four beasts said, Amen.
John	And the four [and] twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.
John	And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.
John	And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.
John	And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.
John	And there went out another horse [that was] red: and [power] was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.
John	And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see.
John	And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.
John	And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and [see] thou hurt not the oil and the wine.
John	And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.
John	And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.
John	And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.
John	And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:
John	And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?
John	And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they [were], should be fulfilled.
John	And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;
John	And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.
John	And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
John	And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;
John	And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:
John	For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?
John	And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.
John	And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,
John	Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.
John	And I heard the number of them which were sealed: [and there were] sealed an hundred [and] forty [and] four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.
John	Of the tribe of Juda [were] sealed twelve thousand.
John	Of the tribe of Reuben [were] sealed twelve thousand.
Paul	Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called [to be] an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,
Paul	(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)
Paul	Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;
Paul	And declared [to be] the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:
Paul	By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:
Paul	Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:
Paul	To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called [to be] saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Paul	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.
Paul	For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;
Paul	Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.
Paul	For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;
Paul	That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.
Paul	Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.
Paul	I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.
Paul	So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.
Paul	For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
Paul	For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.
Paul	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
Paul	Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed [it] unto them.
Paul	For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, [even] his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
Paul	Because that, when they knew God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
Paul	Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
Paul	And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.
Paul	Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:
Paul	Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.
Paul	Amen.
Paul	For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:
Paul	And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.
Paul	And even as they did not like to retain God in [their] knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;
Paul	Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
Paul	Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
Paul	Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:
Paul	Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
Paul	Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.
Paul	But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.
Paul	And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
Paul	Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
Paul	But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
Paul	Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
Paul	To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:
Paul	But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
Paul	Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;
Paul	But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:
Paul	For there is no respect of persons with God.
Paul	For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
Paul	(For not the hearers of the law [are] just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
Paul	For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:
Paul	Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and [their] thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)
Paul	In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.
Paul	Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,
Paul	And knowest [his] will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;
Paul	And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,
Paul	An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.
Paul	Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself?
Paul	thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
Paul	Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery?
Paul	thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?
Paul	Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?
Paul	For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.
Paul	For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.
Paul	Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
Paul	And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?
Paul	For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither [is that] circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:
Paul	But he [is] a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision [is that] of the heart, in the spirit, [and] not in the letter; whose praise [is] not of men, but of God.
Paul	What advantage then hath the Jew?
Paul	or what profit [is there] of circumcision?
Paul	Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.
Paul	For what if some did not believe?
Paul	shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
Paul	God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
Paul	But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say?
Paul	[Is] God unrighteous who taketh vengeance?
Paul	(I speak as a man)
Paul	God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?
Paul	For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
Paul	And not [rather], (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come?
Paul	whose damnation is just.
Paul	What then?
Paul	are we better [than they]?
Paul	No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;
Paul	As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
Paul	There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.
Paul	They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
Paul	Their throat [is] an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps [is] under their lips:
Paul	Whose mouth [is] full of cursing and bitterness:
Paul	Their feet [are] swift to shed blood:
Paul	Destruction and misery [are] in their ways:
Paul	And the way of peace have they not known:
Paul	There is no fear of God before their eyes.
Paul	Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.
Paul	Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law [is] the knowledge of sin.
Paul	But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
Paul	Even the righteousness of God [which is] by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:
Paul	For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
Paul	Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
Paul	Whom God hath set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;
Paul	To declare, [I say], at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
Paul	Where [is] boasting then?
Paul	It is excluded.
Paul	By what law?
Paul	of works?
Paul	Nay: but by the law of faith.
Paul	Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.
Paul	[Is he] the God of the Jews only?
Paul	[is he] not also of the Gentiles?
Paul	Yes, of the Gentiles also:
Paul	Seeing [it is] one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.
Paul	Do we then make void the law through faith?
Paul	God forbid: yea, we establish the law.
Paul	What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?
Paul	For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath [whereof] to glory; but not before God.
Paul	For what saith the scripture?
Paul	Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.
Paul	Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
Paul	But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
Paul	Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,
Paul	[Saying], Blessed [are] they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
Paul	Blessed [is] the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.
Paul	[Cometh] this blessedness then upon the circumcision [only], or upon the uncircumcision also?
Paul	for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.
Paul	How was it then reckoned?
Paul	when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision?
Paul	Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
Paul	And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which [he had yet] being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:
Paul	And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which [he had] being [yet] uncircumcised.
Paul	For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, [was] not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
Paul	For if they which are of the law [be] heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:
Paul	Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, [there is] no transgression.
Paul	Therefore [it is] of faith, that [it might be] by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,
Paul	(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, [even] God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.
Paul	Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.
Paul	And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara’s womb:
Paul	He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;
Paul	And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
Paul	And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
Paul	Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;
Paul	But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;
Paul	Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.
Paul	Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
Paul	By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
Paul	And not only [so], but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
Paul	And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
Paul	And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
Paul	For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
Paul	For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.
Paul	But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
Paul	Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
Paul	For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
Paul	And not only [so], but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.
Paul	Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:
Paul	(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
Paul	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.
Paul	But not as the offence, so also [is] the free gift.
Paul	For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, [which is] by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.
Paul	And not as [it was] by one that sinned, [so is] the gift: for the judgment [was] by one to condemnation, but the free gift [is] of many offences unto justification.
Paul	For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)
Paul	Therefore as by the offence of one [judgment came] upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one [the free gift came] upon all men unto justification of life.
Paul	For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
Paul	Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound.
Paul	But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:
Paul	That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.
Paul	What shall we say then?
Paul	Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
Paul	God forbid.
Paul	How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?
Paul	Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?
Paul	Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
Paul	For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also [in the likeness] of [his] resurrection:
Paul	Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with [him], that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.
Paul	For he that is dead is freed from sin.
Paul	Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:
Paul	Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.
Paul	For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
Paul	Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Paul	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.
Paul	Neither yield ye your members [as] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members [as] instruments of righteousness unto God.
Paul	For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.
Paul	What then?
Paul	shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace?
Paul	God forbid.
Paul	Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?
Paul	But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.
Paul	Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.
Paul	I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.
Paul	For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.
Paul	What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?
Paul	for the end of those things [is] death.
Paul	But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
Paul	For the wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Paul	Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?
Paul	For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to [her] husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of [her] husband.
Paul	So then if, while [her] husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.
Paul	Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, [even] to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.
Paul	For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
Paul	But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not [in] the oldness of the letter.
Paul	What shall we say then?
Paul	[Is] the law sin?
Paul	God forbid.
Paul	Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.
Paul	But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence.
Paul	For without the law sin [was] dead.
Paul	For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.
Paul	And the commandment, which [was ordained] to life, I found [to be] unto death.
Paul	For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew [me].
Paul	Wherefore the law [is] holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.
Paul	Was then that which is good made death unto me?
Paul	God forbid.
Paul	But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.
Paul	For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.
Paul	For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.
Paul	If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that [it is] good.
Paul	Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
Paul	For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but [how] to perform that which is good I find not.
Paul	For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.
Paul	Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
Paul	I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.
Paul	For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:
Paul	But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
Paul	O wretched man that I am!
Paul	who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
Paul	I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Paul	So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
Paul	[There is] therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
Paul	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.
Paul	For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
Paul	That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
Paul	For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
Paul	For to be carnally minded [is] death; but to be spiritually minded [is] life and peace.
Paul	Because the carnal mind [is] enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
Paul	So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
Paul	But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.
Paul	Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
Paul	And if Christ [be] in you, the body [is] dead because of sin; but the Spirit [is] life because of righteousness.
Paul	But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
Paul	Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.
Paul	For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
Paul	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
Paul	For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
Paul	The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:
Paul	And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with [him], that we may be also glorified together.
Paul	For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time [are] not worthy [to be compared] with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
Paul	For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
Paul	For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected [the same] in hope,
Paul	Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
Paul	For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
Paul	And not only [they], but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, [to wit], the redemption of our body.
Paul	For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
Paul	But if we hope for that we see not, [then] do we with patience wait for [it].
Paul	Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
Paul	And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to [the will of] God.
Paul	And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to [his] purpose.
Paul	For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate [to be] conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
Paul	Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
Paul	What shall we then say to these things?
Paul	If God [be] for us, who [can be] against us?
Paul	He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
Paul	Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect?
Paul	[It is] God that justifieth.
Paul	Who [is] he that condemneth?
Paul	[It is] Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
Paul	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
Paul	[shall] tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
Paul	As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
Paul	Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
Paul	For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
Paul	Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Paul	I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,
Paul	That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.
Paul	For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:
Paul	Who are Israelites; to whom [pertaineth] the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service [of God], and the promises;
Paul	Whose [are] the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ [came], who is over all, God blessed for ever.
Paul	Amen.
Paul	Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect.
Paul	For they [are] not all Israel, which are of Israel:
Paul	Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, [are they] all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.
Paul	That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these [are] not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.
Paul	For this [is] the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son.
Paul	And not only [this]; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, [even] by our father Isaac;
Paul	(For [the children] being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)
Paul	It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.
Paul	As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
Paul	What shall we say then?
Paul	[Is there] unrighteousness with God?
Paul	God forbid.
Paul	For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
Paul	So then [it is] not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.
Paul	For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.
Paul	Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will [have mercy], and whom he will he hardeneth.
Paul	Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault?
Paul	For who hath resisted his will?
Paul	Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?
Paul	Shall the thing formed say to him that formed [it], Why hast thou made me thus?
Paul	Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?
Paul	[What] if God, willing to shew [his] wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:
Paul	And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,
Paul	Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?
Paul	As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.
Paul	And it shall come to pass, [that] in the place where it was said unto them, Ye [are] not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.
Paul	Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:
Paul	For he will finish the work, and cut [it] short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.
Paul	And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.
Paul	What shall we say then?
Paul	That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.
Paul	But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.
Paul	Wherefore?
Paul	Because [they sought it] not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law.
Paul	For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;
Paul	As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
Paul	Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.
Paul	For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
Paul	For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.
Paul	For Christ [is] the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.
Paul	For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.
Paul	But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven?
Paul	(that is, to bring Christ down [from above]:)
Paul	Or, Who shall descend into the deep?
Paul	(that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)
Paul	But what saith it?
Paul	The word is nigh thee, [even] in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;
Paul	That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
Paul	For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
Paul	For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
Paul	For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
Paul	For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
Paul	How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?
Paul	and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?
Paul	and how shall they hear without a preacher?
Paul	And how shall they preach, except they be sent?
Paul	as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
Paul	But they have not all obeyed the gospel.
Paul	For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?
Paul	So then faith [cometh] by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
Paul	But I say, Have they not heard?
Paul	Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.
Paul	But I say, Did not Israel know?
Paul	First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by [them that are] no people, [and] by a foolish nation I will anger you.
Paul	But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.
Paul	But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.
Paul	I say then, Hath God cast away his people?
Paul	God forbid.
Paul	For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, [of] the tribe of Benjamin.
Paul	God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew.
Paul	Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias?
Paul	how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,
Paul	Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.
Paul	But what saith the answer of God unto him?
Paul	I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to [the image of] Baal.
Paul	Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
Paul	And if by grace, then [is it] no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace.
Paul	But if [it be] of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.
Paul	What then?
Paul	Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded
Paul	(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.
Paul	And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:
Paul	Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.
Paul	I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall?
Paul	God forbid: but [rather] through their fall salvation [is come] unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.
Paul	Now if the fall of them [be] the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?
Paul	For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:
Paul	If by any means I may provoke to emulation [them which are] my flesh, and might save some of them.
Paul	For if the casting away of them [be] the reconciling of the world, what [shall] the receiving [of them be], but life from the dead?
Paul	For if the firstfruit [be] holy, the lump [is] also [holy]: and if the root [be] holy, so [are] the branches.
Paul	And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;
Paul	Boast not against the branches.
Paul	But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
Paul	Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.
Paul	Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith.
Paul	Be not highminded, but fear:
Paul	For if God spared not the natural branches, [take heed] lest he also spare not thee.
Paul	Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in [his] goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
Paul	And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.
Paul	For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural [branches], be graffed into their own olive tree?
Paul	For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.
Paul	And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:
Paul	For this [is] my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.
Paul	As concerning the gospel, [they are] enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, [they are] beloved for the fathers’ sakes.
Paul	For the gifts and calling of God [are] without repentance.
Paul	For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:
Paul	Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.
Paul	For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.
Paul	O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
Paul	how unsearchable [are] his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
Paul	For who hath known the mind of the Lord?
Paul	or who hath been his counseller?
Paul	Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
Paul	For of him, and through him, and to him, [are] all things: to whom [be] glory for ever.
Paul	Amen.
Paul	I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, [which is] your reasonable service.
Paul	And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what [is] that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
Paul	For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think [of himself] more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.
Paul	For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:
Paul	So we, [being] many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.
Paul	Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, [let us prophesy] according to the proportion of faith;
Paul	Or ministry, [let us wait] on [our] ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;
Paul	Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, [let him do it] with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.
Paul	[Let] love be without dissimulation.
Paul	Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.
Paul	[Be] kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;
Paul	Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
Paul	Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;
Paul	Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.
Paul	Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.
Paul	Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.
Paul	[Be] of the same mind one toward another.
Paul	Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate.
Paul	Be not wise in your own conceits.
Paul	Recompense to no man evil for evil.
Paul	Provide things honest in the sight of all men.
Paul	If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.
Paul	Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but [rather] give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance [is] mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.
Paul	Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.
Paul	Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
Paul	Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.
Paul	For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.
Paul	Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.
Paul	For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.
Paul	Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power?
Paul	do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:
Paul	For he is the minister of God to thee for good.
Paul	But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to [execute] wrath upon him that doeth evil.
Paul	Wherefore [ye] must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.
Paul	For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God’s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.
Paul	Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute [is due]; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.
Paul	Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
Paul	For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if [there be] any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
Paul	Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love [is] the fulfilling of the law.
Paul	And that, knowing the time, that now [it is] high time to awake out of sleep: for now [is] our salvation nearer than when we believed.
Paul	The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.
Paul	Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.
Paul	But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to [fulfil] the lusts [thereof].
Paul	Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, [but] not to doubtful disputations.
Paul	For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.
Paul	Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.
Paul	Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant?
Paul	to his own master he standeth or falleth.
Paul	Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.
Paul	One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day [alike].
Paul	Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
Paul	He that regardeth the day, regardeth [it] unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard [it].
Paul	He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.
Paul	For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
Paul	For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.
Paul	For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.
Paul	But why dost thou judge thy brother?
Paul	or why dost thou set at nought thy brother?
Paul	for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
Paul	For it is written, [As] I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
Paul	So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.
Paul	Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in [his] brother’s way.
Paul	I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that [there is] nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him [it is] unclean.
Paul	But if thy brother be grieved with [thy] meat, now walkest thou not charitably.
Paul	Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.
Paul	Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
Paul	For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
Paul	For he that in these things serveth Christ [is] acceptable to God, and approved of men.
Paul	Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.
Paul	For meat destroy not the work of God.
Paul	All things indeed [are] pure; but [it is] evil for that man who eateth with offence.
Paul	[It is] good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor [any thing] whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.
Paul	Hast thou faith?
Paul	have [it] to thyself before God.
Paul	Happy [is] he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.
Paul	And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because [he eateth] not of faith: for whatsoever [is] not of faith is sin.
Paul	We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
Paul	Let every one of us please [his] neighbour for [his] good to edification.
Paul	For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.
Paul	For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.
Paul	Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:
Paul	That ye may with one mind [and] one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Paul	Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.
Paul	Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises [made] unto the fathers:
Paul	And that the Gentiles might glorify God for [his] mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.
Paul	And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
Paul	And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.
Paul	And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.
Paul	Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.
Paul	And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
Paul	Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,
Paul	That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.
Paul	I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.
Paul	For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,
Paul	Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.
Paul	Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation:
Paul	But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.
Paul	For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.
Paul	But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;
Paul	Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your [company].
Paul	But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.
Paul	For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.
Paul	It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are.
Paul	For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.
Paul	When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.
Paul	And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.
Paul	Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in [your] prayers to God for me;
Paul	That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which [I have] for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;
Paul	That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.
Paul	Now the God of peace [be] with you all.
Paul	Amen.
Paul	I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:
Paul	That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.
Paul	Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:
Paul	Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.
Paul	Likewise [greet] the church that is in their house.
Paul	Salute my wellbeloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.
Paul	Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.
Paul	Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.
Paul	Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.
Paul	Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
Paul	Salute Apelles approved in Christ.
Paul	Salute them which are of Aristobulus’ [household].
Paul	Salute Herodion my kinsman.
Paul	Greet them that be of the [household] of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.
Paul	Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord.
Paul	Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord.
Paul	Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
Paul	Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them.
Paul	Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.
Paul	Salute one another with an holy kiss.
Paul	The churches of Christ salute you.
Paul	Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.
Paul	For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.
Paul	For your obedience is come abroad unto all [men].
Paul	I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.
Paul	And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.
Paul	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you.
Paul	Amen.
Paul	Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.
Paul	I Tertius, who wrote [this] epistle, salute you in the Lord.
Paul	Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you.
Paul	Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.
Paul	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all.
Paul	Amen.
Paul	Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,
Paul	But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:
Paul	To God only wise, [be] glory through Jesus Christ for ever.
Paul	Amen.
Paul	Paul, called [to be] an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes [our] brother,
Paul	Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called [to be] saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:
Paul	Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.
Paul	I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;
Paul	That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and [in] all knowledge;
Paul	Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:
Paul	So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:
Paul	Who shall also confirm you unto the end, [that ye may be] blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Paul	God [is] faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
Paul	Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and [that] there be no divisions among you; but [that] ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.
Paul	For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them [which are of the house] of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
Paul	Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.
Paul	Is Christ divided?
Paul	was Paul crucified for you?
Paul	or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?
Paul	I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;
Paul	Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.
Paul	And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.
Paul	For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.
Paul	For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.
Paul	For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.
Paul	Where [is] the wise?
Paul	where [is] the scribe?
Paul	where [is] the disputer of this world?
Paul	hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
Paul	For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
Paul	For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:
Paul	But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;
Paul	But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
Paul	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
Paul	For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, [are called]:
Paul	But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;
Paul	And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, [yea], and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:
Paul	That no flesh should glory in his presence.
Paul	But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
Paul	That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
Paul	And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.
Paul	For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
Paul	And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
Paul	And my speech and my preaching [was] not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:
Paul	That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
Paul	Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:
Paul	But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, [even] the hidden [wisdom], which God ordained before the world unto our glory:
Paul	Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known [it], they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
Paul	But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.
Paul	But God hath revealed [them] unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
Paul	For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him?
Paul	even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.
Paul	Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
Paul	Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
Paul	But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know [them], because they are spiritually discerned.
Paul	But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.
Paul	For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him?
Paul	But we have the mind of Christ.
Paul	And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, [even] as unto babes in Christ.
Paul	I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able [to bear it], neither yet now are ye able.
Paul	For ye are yet carnal: for whereas [there is] among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?
Paul	For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I [am] of Apollos; are ye not carnal?
Paul	Who then is Paul, and who [is] Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?
Paul	I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
Paul	So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.
Paul	Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.
Paul	For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, [ye are] God’s building.
Paul	According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon.
Paul	But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.
Paul	For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
Paul	Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;
Paul	Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.
Paul	If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.
Paul	If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.
Paul	Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
Paul	If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which [temple] ye are.
Paul	Let no man deceive himself.
Paul	If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.
Paul	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.
Paul	For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.
Paul	And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.
Paul	Therefore let no man glory in men.
Paul	For all things are yours;
Paul	Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;
Paul	And ye are Christ’s; and Christ [is] God’s.
Paul	Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
Paul	Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
Paul	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.
Paul	For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
Paul	Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.
Paul	And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and [to] Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think [of men] above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.
Paul	For who maketh thee to differ [from another]?
Paul	and what hast thou that thou didst not receive?
Paul	now if thou didst receive [it], why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received [it]?
Paul	Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.
Paul	For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.
Paul	We [are] fools for Christ’s sake, but ye [are] wise in Christ; we [are] weak, but ye [are] strong; ye [are] honourable, but we [are] despised.
Paul	Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;
Paul	And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:
Paul	Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, [and are] the offscouring of all things unto this day.
Paul	I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn [you].
Paul	For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet [have ye] not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.
Paul	Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.
Paul	For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.
Paul	Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.
Paul	But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.
Paul	For the kingdom of God [is] not in word, but in power.
Paul	What will ye?
Paul	shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and [in] the spirit of meekness?
Paul	It is reported commonly [that there is] fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife.
Paul	And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.
Paul	For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, [concerning] him that hath so done this deed,
Paul	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
Paul	To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
Paul	Your glorying [is] not good.
Paul	Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
Paul	Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened.
Paul	For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:
Paul	Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened [bread] of sincerity and truth.
Paul	I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:
Paul	Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.
Paul	But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.
Paul	For what have I to do to judge them also that are without?
Paul	do not ye judge them that are within?
Paul	But them that are without God judgeth.
Paul	Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
Paul	Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?
Paul	Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?
Paul	and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
Paul	Know ye not that we shall judge angels?
Paul	how much more things that pertain to this life?
Paul	If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.
Paul	I speak to your shame.
Paul	Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you?
Paul	no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?
Paul	But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.
Paul	Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another.
Paul	Why do ye not rather take wrong?
Paul	why do ye not rather [suffer yourselves to] be defrauded?
Paul	Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that [your] brethren.
Paul	Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?
Paul	Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
Paul	Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
Paul	And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
Paul	All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.
Paul	Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them.
Paul	Now the body [is] not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.
Paul	And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.
Paul	Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ?
Paul	shall I then take the members of Christ, and make [them] the members of an harlot?
Paul	God forbid.
Paul	What?
Paul	know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body?
Paul	for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.
Paul	But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
Paul	Flee fornication.
Paul	Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
Paul	What?
Paul	know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost [which is] in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?
Paul	For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.
Paul	Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: [It is] good for a man not to touch a woman.
Paul	Nevertheless, [to avoid] fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.
Paul	Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.
Paul	The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.
Paul	Defraud ye not one the other, except [it be] with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.
Paul	But I speak this by permission, [and] not of commandment.
Paul	For I would that all men were even as I myself.
Paul	But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.
Paul	I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.
Paul	But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.
Paul	And unto the married I command, [yet] not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from [her] husband:
Paul	But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to [her] husband: and let not the husband put away [his] wife.
Paul	But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.
Paul	And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.
Paul	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.
Paul	But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart.
Paul	A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such [cases]: but God hath called us to peace.
Paul	For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save [thy] husband?
Paul	or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save [thy] wife?
Paul	But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk.
Paul	And so ordain I in all churches.
Paul	Is any man called being circumcised?
Paul	let him not become uncircumcised.
Paul	Is any called in uncircumcision?
Paul	let him not be circumcised.
Paul	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.
Paul	Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
Paul	Art thou called [being] a servant?
Paul	care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use [it] rather.
Paul	For he that is called in the Lord, [being] a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, [being] free, is Christ’s servant.
Paul	Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.
Paul	Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.
Paul	Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.
Paul	I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, [I say], that [it is] good for a man so to be.
Paul	Art thou bound unto a wife?
Paul	seek not to be loosed.
Paul	Art thou loosed from a wife?
Paul	seek not a wife.
Paul	But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned.
Paul	Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.
Paul	But this I say, brethren, the time [is] short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;
Paul	And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;
Paul	And they that use this world, as not abusing [it]: for the fashion of this world passeth away.
Paul	But I would have you without carefulness.
Paul	He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:
Paul	But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please [his] wife.
Paul	There is difference [also] between a wife and a virgin.
Paul	The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please [her] husband.
Paul	And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.
Paul	But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of [her] age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.
Paul	Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.
Paul	So then he that giveth [her] in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth [her] not in marriage doeth better.
Paul	The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.
Paul	But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.
Paul	Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge.
Paul	Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.
Paul	And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.
Paul	But if any man love God, the same is known of him.
Paul	As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol [is] nothing in the world, and that [there is] none other God but one.
Paul	For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)
Paul	But to us [there is but] one God, the Father, of whom [are] all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom [are] all things, and we by him.
Paul	Howbeit [there is] not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat [it] as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.
Paul	But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.
Paul	But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.
Paul	For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol’s temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;
Paul	And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?
Paul	But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.
Paul	Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.
Paul	Am I not an apostle?
Paul	am I not free?
Paul	have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?
Paul	are not ye my work in the Lord?
Paul	If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.
Paul	Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,
Paul	Have we not power to eat and to drink?
Paul	Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and [as] the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?
Paul	Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?
Paul	Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges?
Paul	who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof?
Paul	or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?
Paul	Say I these things as a man?
Paul	or saith not the law the same also?
Paul	For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn.
Paul	Doth God take care for oxen?
Paul	Or saith he [it] altogether for our sakes?
Paul	For our sakes, no doubt, [this] is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.
Paul	If we have sown unto you spiritual things, [is it] a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?
Paul	If others be partakers of [this] power over you, [are] not we rather?
Paul	Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.
Paul	Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live [of the things] of the temple?
Paul	and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?
Paul	Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.
Paul	But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for [it were] better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.
Paul	For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!
Paul	For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation [of the gospel] is committed unto me.
Paul	What is my reward then?
Paul	[Verily] that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.
Paul	For though I be free from all [men], yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.
Paul	And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;
Paul	To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.
Paul	To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all [men], that I might by all means save some.
Paul	And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with [you].
Paul	Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize?
Paul	So run, that ye may obtain.
Paul	And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things.
Paul	Now they [do it] to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
Paul	I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:
Paul	But I keep under my body, and bring [it] into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.
Paul	Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
Paul	And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
Paul	And did all eat the same spiritual meat;
Paul	And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.
Paul	But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
Paul	Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
Paul	Neither be ye idolaters, as [were] some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.
Paul	Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.
Paul	Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.
Paul	Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.
Paul	Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.
Paul	Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.
Paul	There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God [is] faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear [it].
Paul	Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.
Paul	I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
Paul	The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?
Paul	The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
Paul	For we [being] many are one bread, [and] one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.
Paul	Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
Paul	What say I then?
Paul	that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?
Paul	But [I say], that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.
Paul	Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils.
Paul	Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?
Paul	are we stronger than he?
Paul	All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.
Paul	Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s [wealth].
Paul	Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, [that] eat, asking no question for conscience sake:
Paul	For the earth [is] the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.
Paul	If any of them that believe not bid you [to a feast], and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.
Paul	But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth [is] the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof:
Paul	Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another [man’s] conscience?
Paul	For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?
Paul	Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.
Paul	Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:
Paul	Even as I please all [men] in all [things], not seeking mine own profit, but the [profit] of many, that they may be saved.
Paul	Be ye followers of me, even as I also [am] of Christ.
Paul	Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered [them] to you.
Paul	But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman [is] the man; and the head of Christ [is] God.
Paul	Every man praying or prophesying, having [his] head covered, dishonoureth his head.
Paul	But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with [her] head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.
Paul	For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
Paul	For a man indeed ought not to cover [his] head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
Paul	For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.
Paul	Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.
Paul	For this cause ought the woman to have power on [her] head because of the angels.
Paul	Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.
Paul	For as the woman [is] of the man, even so [is] the man also by the woman; but all things of God.
Paul	Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
Paul	Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?
Paul	But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for [her] hair is given her for a covering.
Paul	But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
Paul	Now in this that I declare [unto you] I praise [you] not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.
Paul	For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.
Paul	For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.
Paul	When ye come together therefore into one place, [this] is not to eat the Lord’s supper.
Paul	For in eating every one taketh before [other] his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
Paul	What?
Paul	have ye not houses to eat and to drink in?
Paul	or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not?
Paul	What shall I say to you?
Paul	shall I praise you in this?
Paul	I praise [you] not.
Paul	For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the [same] night in which he was betrayed took bread:
Paul	And when he had given thanks, he brake [it], and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.
Paul	After the same manner also [he took] the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink [it], in remembrance of me.
Paul	For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.
Paul	Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink [this] cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
Paul	But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of [that] bread, and drink of [that] cup.
Paul	For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.
Paul	For this cause many [are] weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
Paul	For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
Paul	But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
Paul	Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.
Paul	And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation.
Paul	And the rest will I set in order when I come.
Paul	Now concerning spiritual [gifts], brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
Paul	Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.
Paul	Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and [that] no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
Paul	Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
Paul	And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.
Paul	And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.
Paul	But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
Paul	For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
Paul	To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
Paul	To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another [divers] kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:
Paul	But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.
Paul	For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also [is] Christ.
Paul	For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether [we be] Jews or Gentiles, whether [we be] bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
Paul	For the body is not one member, but many.
Paul	If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
Paul	And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
Paul	If the whole body [were] an eye, where [were] the hearing?
Paul	If the whole [were] hearing, where [were] the smelling?
Paul	But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.
Paul	And if they were all one member, where [were] the body?
Paul	But now [are they] many members, yet but one body.
Paul	And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
Paul	Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:
Paul	And those [members] of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness.
Paul	For our comely [parts] have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that [part] which lacked:
Paul	That there should be no schism in the body; but [that] the members should have the same care one for another.
Paul	And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.
Paul	Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
Paul	And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.
Paul	[Are] all apostles?
Paul	[are] all prophets?
Paul	[are] all teachers?
Paul	[are] all workers of miracles?
Paul	Have all the gifts of healing?
Paul	do all speak with tongues?
Paul	do all interpret?
Paul	But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.
Paul	Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become [as] sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
Paul	And though I have [the gift of] prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
Paul	And though I bestow all my goods to feed [the poor], and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
Paul	Charity suffereth long, [and] is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
Paul	Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;
Paul	Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
Paul	Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
Paul	Charity never faileth: but whether [there be] prophecies, they shall fail; whether [there be] tongues, they shall cease; whether [there be] knowledge, it shall vanish away.
Paul	For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
Paul	But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
Paul	When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
Paul	For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
Paul	And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these [is] charity.
Paul	Follow after charity, and desire spiritual [gifts], but rather that ye may prophesy.
Paul	For he that speaketh in an [unknown] tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth [him]; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.
Paul	But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men [to] edification, and exhortation, and comfort.
Paul	He that speaketh in an [unknown] tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.
Paul	I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater [is] he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.
Paul	Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?
Paul	And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
Paul	For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?
Paul	So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken?
Paul	for ye shall speak into the air.
Paul	There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them [is] without signification.
Paul	Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh [shall be] a barbarian unto me.
Paul	Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual [gifts], seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.
Paul	Wherefore let him that speaketh in an [unknown] tongue pray that he may interpret.
Paul	For if I pray in an [unknown] tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.
Paul	What is it then?
Paul	I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
Paul	Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?
Paul	For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.
Paul	I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:
Paul	Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that [by my voice] I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an [unknown] tongue.
Paul	Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.
Paul	In the law it is written, With [men of] other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.
Paul	Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying [serveth] not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.
Paul	If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in [those that are] unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?
Paul	But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or [one] unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:
Paul	And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on [his] face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.
Paul	How is it then, brethren?
Paul	when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation.
Paul	Let all things be done unto edifying.
Paul	If any man speak in an [unknown] tongue, [let it be] by two, or at the most [by] three, and [that] by course; and let one interpret.
Paul	But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.
Paul	Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.
Paul	If [any thing] be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.
Paul	For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.
Paul	And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
Paul	For God is not [the author] of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.
Paul	Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but [they are commanded] to be under obedience, as also saith the law.
Paul	And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.
Paul	What?
Paul	came the word of God out from you?
Paul	or came it unto you only?
Paul	If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.
Paul	But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
Paul	Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.
Paul	Let all things be done decently and in order.
Paul	Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
Paul	By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
Paul	For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
Paul	And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
Paul	And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:
Paul	After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.
Paul	After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.
Paul	And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.
Paul	For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
Paul	But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which [was bestowed] upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
Paul	Therefore whether [it were] I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.
Paul	Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?
Paul	But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:
Paul	And if Christ be not risen, then [is] our preaching vain, and your faith [is] also vain.
Paul	Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.
Paul	For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:
Paul	And if Christ be not raised, your faith [is] vain; ye are yet in your sins.
Paul	Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
Paul	If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
Paul	But now is Christ risen from the dead, [and] become the firstfruits of them that slept.
Paul	For since by man [came] death, by man [came] also the resurrection of the dead.
Paul	For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.
Paul	But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming.
Paul	Then [cometh] the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.
Paul	For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.
Paul	The last enemy [that] shall be destroyed [is] death.
Paul	For he hath put all things under his feet.
Paul	But when he saith, all things are put under [him, it is] manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.
Paul	And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.
Paul	Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all?
Paul	why are they then baptized for the dead?
Paul	And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?
Paul	I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
Paul	If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not?
Paul	let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.
Paul	Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.
Paul	Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak [this] to your shame.
Paul	But some [man] will say, How are the dead raised up?
Paul	and with what body do they come?
Paul	[Thou] fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:
Paul	And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other [grain]:
Paul	But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.
Paul	All flesh [is] not the same flesh: but [there is] one [kind of] flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, [and] another of birds.
Paul	[There are] also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial [is] one, and the [glory] of the terrestrial [is] another.
Paul	[There is] one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for [one] star differeth from [another] star in glory.
Paul	So also [is] the resurrection of the dead.
Paul	It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
Paul	It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
Paul	It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.
Paul	There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
Paul	And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam [was made] a quickening spirit.
Paul	Howbeit that [was] not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.
Paul	The first man [is] of the earth, earthy: the second man [is] the Lord from heaven.
Paul	As [is] the earthy, such [are] they also that are earthy: and as [is] the heavenly, such [are] they also that are heavenly.
Paul	And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
Paul	Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
Paul	Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
Paul	In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
Paul	For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal [must] put on immortality.
Paul	So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
Paul	O death, where [is] thy sting?
Paul	O grave, where [is] thy victory?
Paul	The sting of death [is] sin; and the strength of sin [is] the law.
Paul	But thanks [be] to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Paul	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
Paul	Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.
Paul	Upon the first [day] of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as [God] hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.
Paul	And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by [your] letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.
Paul	And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.
Paul	Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.
Paul	And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.
Paul	For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.
Paul	But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.
Paul	For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and [there are] many adversaries.
Paul	Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also [do].
Paul	Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.
Paul	As touching [our] brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.
Paul	Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.
Paul	Let all your things be done with charity.
Paul	I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and [that] they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)
Paul	That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with [us], and laboureth.
Paul	I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.
Paul	For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.
Paul	The churches of Asia salute you.
Paul	Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.
Paul	All the brethren greet you.
Paul	Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.
Paul	The salutation of [me] Paul with mine own hand.
Paul	If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.
Paul	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you.
Paul	My love [be] with you all in Christ Jesus.
Paul	Amen.
Paul	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy [our] brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:
Paul	Grace [be] to you and peace from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.
Paul	Blessed [be] God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;
Paul	Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.
Paul	For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.
Paul	And whether we be afflicted, [it is] for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, [it is] for your consolation and salvation.
Paul	And our hope of you [is] stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so [shall ye be] also of the consolation.
Paul	For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:
Paul	But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:
Paul	Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver [us];
Paul	Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift [bestowed] upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.
Paul	For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.
Paul	For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;
Paul	As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also [are] ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.
Paul	And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;
Paul	And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.
Paul	When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness?
Paul	or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?
Paul	But [as] God [is] true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.
Paul	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, [even] by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.
Paul	For all the promises of God in him [are] yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.
Paul	Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, [is] God;
Paul	Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
Paul	Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.
Paul	Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.
Paul	But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.
Paul	For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?
Paul	And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is [the joy] of you all.
Paul	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.
Paul	But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.
Paul	Sufficient to such a man [is] this punishment, which [was inflicted] of many.
Paul	So that contrariwise ye [ought] rather to forgive [him], and comfort [him], lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.
Paul	Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm [your] love toward him.
Paul	For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.
Paul	To whom ye forgive any thing, I [forgive] also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave [it], for your sakes [forgave I it] in the person of Christ;
Paul	Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
Paul	Furthermore, when I came to Troas to [preach] Christ’s gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,
Paul	I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.
Paul	Now thanks [be] unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.
Paul	For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:
Paul	To the one [we are] the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life.
Paul	And who [is] sufficient for these things?
Paul	For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.
Paul	Do we begin again to commend ourselves?
Paul	or need we, as some [others], epistles of commendation to you, or [letters] of commendation from you?
Paul	Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:
Paul	[Forasmuch as ye are] manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.
Paul	And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:
Paul	Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency [is] of God;
Paul	Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
Paul	But if the ministration of death, written [and] engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which [glory] was to be done away:
Paul	How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?
Paul	For if the ministration of condemnation [be] glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
Paul	For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.
Paul	For if that which is done away [was] glorious, much more that which remaineth [is] glorious.
Paul	Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:
Paul	And not as Moses, [which] put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:
Paul	But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which [vail] is done away in Christ.
Paul	But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.
Paul	Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.
Paul	Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord [is], there [is] liberty.
Paul	But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, [even] as by the Spirit of the Lord.
Paul	Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;
Paul	But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.
Paul	But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:
Paul	In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
Paul	For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake.
Paul	For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to [give] the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
Paul	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.
Paul	[We are] troubled on every side, yet not distressed; [we are] perplexed, but not in despair;
Paul	Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
Paul	Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.
Paul	For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
Paul	So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
Paul	We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;
Paul	Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present [us] with you.
Paul	For all things [are] for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.
Paul	For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward [man] is renewed day by day.
Paul	For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding [and] eternal weight of glory;
Paul	While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen [are] temporal; but the things which are not seen [are] eternal.
Paul	For we know that if our earthly house of [this] tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
Paul	For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:
Paul	If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
Paul	For we that are in [this] tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.
Paul	Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing [is] God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
Paul	Therefore [we are] always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
Paul	(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)
Paul	We are confident, [I say], and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.
Paul	Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.
Paul	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things [done] in [his] body, according to that he hath done, whether [it be] good or bad.
Paul	Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.
Paul	For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to [answer] them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.
Paul	For whether we be beside ourselves, [it is] to God: or whether we be sober, [it is] for your cause.
Paul	For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:
Paul	And [that] he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.
Paul	Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we [him] no more.
Paul	Therefore if any man [be] in Christ, [he is] a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.
Paul	And all things [are] of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;
Paul	To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.
Paul	Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech [you] by us: we pray [you] in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God.
Paul	For he hath made him [to be] sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
Paul	We then, [as] workers together [with him], beseech [you] also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.
Paul	(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now [is] the accepted time; behold, now [is] the day of salvation.)
Paul	Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:
Paul	But in all [things] approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
Paul	In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;
Paul	By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,
Paul	By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
Paul	By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and [yet] true;
Paul	As unknown, and [yet] well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;
Paul	As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and [yet] possessing all things.
Paul	O [ye] Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.
Paul	Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.
Paul	Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto [my] children,) be ye also enlarged.
Paul	Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?
Paul	and what communion hath light with darkness?
Paul	And what concord hath Christ with Belial?
Paul	or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?
Paul	And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols?
Paul	for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in [them]; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
Paul	Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean [thing]; and I will receive you,
Paul	And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
Paul	Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
Paul	Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.
Paul	I speak not [this] to condemn [you]: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with [you].
Paul	Great [is] my boldness of speech toward you, great [is] my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.
Paul	For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without [were] fightings, within [were] fears.
Paul	Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
Paul	And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.
Paul	For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though [it were] but for a season.
Paul	Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.
Paul	For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.
Paul	For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, [what] clearing of yourselves, yea, [what] indignation, yea, [what] fear, yea, [what] vehement desire, yea, [what] zeal, yea, [what] revenge!
Paul	In all [things] ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.
Paul	Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, [I did it] not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.
Paul	Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.
Paul	For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which [I made] before Titus, is found a truth.
Paul	And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.
Paul	I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all [things].
Paul	Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;
Paul	How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
Paul	For to [their] power, I bear record, yea, and beyond [their] power [they were] willing of themselves;
Paul	Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and [take upon us] the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.
Paul	And [this they did], not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.
Paul	Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.
Paul	Therefore, as ye abound in every [thing, in] faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and [in] all diligence, and [in] your love to us, [see] that ye abound in this grace also.
Paul	I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.
Paul	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.
Paul	And herein I give [my] advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.
Paul	Now therefore perform the doing [of it]; that as [there was] a readiness to will, so [there may be] a performance also out of that which ye have.
Paul	For if there be first a willing mind, [it is] accepted according to that a man hath, [and] not according to that he hath not.
Paul	For [I mean] not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:
Paul	But by an equality, [that] now at this time your abundance [may be a supply] for their want, that their abundance also may be [a supply] for your want: that there may be equality:
Paul	As it is written, He that [had gathered] much had nothing over; and he that [had gathered] little had no lack.
Paul	But thanks [be] to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.
Paul	For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.
Paul	And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise [is] in the gospel throughout all the churches;
Paul	And not [that] only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and [declaration of] your ready mind:
Paul	Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:
Paul	Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
Paul	And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which [I have] in you.
Paul	Whether [any do inquire] of Titus, [he is] my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren [be inquired of, they are] the messengers of the churches, [and] the glory of Christ.
Paul	Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.
Paul	For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:
Paul	For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.
Paul	Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:
Paul	Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.
Paul	Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as [a matter of] bounty, and not as [of] covetousness.
Paul	But this [I say], He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.
Paul	Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, [so let him give]; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.
Paul	And God [is] able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all [things], may abound to every good work:
Paul	(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.
Paul	Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for [your] food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)
Paul	Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.
Paul	For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;
Paul	Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for [your] liberal distribution unto them, and unto all [men];
Paul	And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.
Paul	Thanks [be] unto God for his unspeakable gift.
Paul	Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence [am] base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:
Paul	But I beseech [you], that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.
Paul	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:
Paul	(For the weapons of our warfare [are] not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)
Paul	Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;
Paul	And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.
Paul	Do ye look on things after the outward appearance?
Paul	If any man trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he [is] Christ’s, even so [are] we Christ’s.
Paul	For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:
Paul	That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
Paul	For [his] letters, say they, [are] weighty and powerful; but [his] bodily presence [is] weak, and [his] speech contemptible.
Paul	Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such [will we be] also in deed when we are present.
Paul	For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.
Paul	But we will not boast of things without [our] measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.
Paul	For we stretch not ourselves beyond [our measure], as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in [preaching] the gospel of Christ:
Paul	Not boasting of things without [our] measure, [that is], of other men’s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,
Paul	To preach the gospel in the [regions] beyond you, [and] not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to our hand.
Paul	But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
Paul	For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.
Paul	Would to God ye could bear with me a little in [my] folly: and indeed bear with me.
Paul	For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present [you as] a chaste virgin to Christ.
Paul	But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
Paul	For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or [if] ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with [him].
Paul	For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.
Paul	But though [I be] rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.
Paul	Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?
Paul	I robbed other churches, taking wages [of them], to do you service.
Paul	And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all [things] I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and [so] will I keep [myself].
Paul	As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.
Paul	Wherefore?
Paul	because I love you not?
Paul	God knoweth.
Paul	But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.
Paul	For such [are] false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.
Paul	And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
Paul	Therefore [it is] no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
Paul	I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.
Paul	That which I speak, I speak [it] not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.
Paul	Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
Paul	For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye [yourselves] are wise.
Paul	For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour [you], if a man take [of you], if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.
Paul	I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak.
Paul	Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.
Paul	Are they Hebrews?
Paul	so [am] I.
Paul	Are they Israelites?
Paul	so [am] I.
Paul	Are they the seed of Abraham?
Paul	so [am] I.
Paul	Are they ministers of Christ?
Paul	(I speak as a fool) I [am] more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.
Paul	Of the Jews five times received I forty [stripes] save one.
Paul	Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;
Paul	[In] journeyings often, [in] perils of waters, [in] perils of robbers, [in] perils by [mine own] countrymen, [in] perils by the heathen, [in] perils in the city, [in] perils in the wilderness, [in] perils in the sea, [in] perils among false brethren;
Paul	In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
Paul	Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.
Paul	Who is weak, and I am not weak?
Paul	who is offended, and I burn not?
Paul	If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.
Paul	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.
Paul	In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:
Paul	And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.
Paul	It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory.
Paul	I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
Paul	I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.
Paul	And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)
Paul	How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
Paul	Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.
Paul	For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but [now] I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me [to be], or [that] he heareth of me.
Paul	And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.
Paul	For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
Paul	And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.
Paul	Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
Paul	Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
Paul	I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.
Paul	Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.
Paul	For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except [it be] that I myself was not burdensome to you?
Paul	forgive me this wrong.
Paul	Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
Paul	And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.
Paul	But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.
Paul	Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?
Paul	I desired Titus, and with [him] I sent a brother.
Paul	Did Titus make a gain of you?
Paul	walked we not in the same spirit?
Paul	[walked we] not in the same steps?
Paul	Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you?
Paul	we speak before God in Christ: but [we do] all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.
Paul	For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and [that] I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest [there be] debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:
Paul	[And] lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and [that] I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.
Paul	This [is] the third [time] I am coming to you.
Paul	In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
Paul	I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:
Paul	Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.
Peter	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
Peter	Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.
Peter	Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
Peter	To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,
Peter	Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
Peter	Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:
Peter	That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:
Peter	Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see [him] not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:
Peter	Receiving the end of your faith, [even] the salvation of [your] souls.
Peter	Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace [that should come] unto you:
Peter	Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.
Peter	Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.
Peter	Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;
Peter	As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:
Peter	But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;
Peter	Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.
Peter	And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning [here] in fear:
Peter	Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, [as] silver and gold, from your vain conversation [received] by tradition from your fathers;
Peter	But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:
Peter	Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,
Peter	Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.
Peter	Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, [see that ye] love one another with a pure heart fervently:
Peter	Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.
Peter	For all flesh [is] as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass.
Peter	The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:
Peter	But the word of the Lord endureth for ever.
Peter	And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.
Peter	Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,
Peter	As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:
Peter	If so be ye have tasted that the Lord [is] gracious.
Peter	To whom coming, [as unto] a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, [and] precious,
Peter	Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
Peter	Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.
Peter	Unto you therefore which believe [he is] precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,
Peter	And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, [even to them] which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.
Peter	But ye [are] a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:
Peter	Which in time past [were] not a people, but [are] now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
Peter	Dearly beloved, I beseech [you] as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;
Peter	Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by [your] good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
Peter	Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;
Peter	Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.
Peter	For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:
Peter	As free, and not using [your] liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.
Peter	Honour all [men].
Peter	Love the brotherhood.
Peter	Fear God.
Peter	Honour the king.
Peter	Servants, [be] subject to [your] masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.
Peter	For this [is] thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.
Peter	For what glory [is it], if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently?
Peter	but if, when ye do well, and suffer [for it], ye take it patiently, this [is] acceptable with God.
Peter	For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:
Peter	Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:
Peter	Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed [himself] to him that judgeth righteously:
Peter	Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.
Peter	For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
Peter	Likewise, ye wives, [be] in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;
Peter	While they behold your chaste conversation [coupled] with fear.
Peter	Whose adorning let it not be that outward [adorning] of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;
Peter	But [let it be] the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, [even the ornament] of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.
Peter	For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:
Peter	Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.
Peter	Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with [them] according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.
Peter	Finally, [be ye] all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, [be] pitiful, [be] courteous:
Peter	Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.
Peter	For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:
Peter	Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.
Peter	For the eyes of the Lord [are] over the righteous, and his ears [are open] unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord [is] against them that do evil.
Peter	And who [is] he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?
Peter	But and if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy [are ye]: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;
Peter	But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and [be] ready always to [give] an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:
Peter	Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.
Peter	For [it is] better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.
Peter	For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:
Peter	By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;
Peter	Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.
Peter	The like figure whereunto [even] baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:
Peter	Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.
Peter	Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;
Peter	That he no longer should live the rest of [his] time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.
Peter	For the time past of [our] life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:
Peter	Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with [them] to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of [you]:
Peter	Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.
Peter	For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
Peter	But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.
Peter	And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.
Peter	Use hospitality one to another without grudging.
Peter	As every man hath received the gift, [even so] minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
Peter	If any man speak, [let him speak] as the oracles of God; if any man minister, [let him do it] as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever.
Peter	Amen.
Peter	Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:
Peter	But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.
Peter	If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy [are ye]; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.
Peter	But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or [as] a thief, or [as] an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters.
Peter	Yet if [any man suffer] as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.
Peter	For the time [is come] that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if [it] first [begin] at us, what shall the end [be] of them that obey not the gospel of God?
Peter	And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?
Peter	Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls [to him] in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.
Peter	The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:
Peter	Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight [thereof], not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;
Peter	Neither as being lords over [God’s] heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.
Peter	And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.
Peter	Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder.
Peter	Yea, all [of you] be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.
Peter	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:
Peter	Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.
Peter	Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:
Peter	Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.
Peter	But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle [you].
Peter	To him [be] glory and dominion for ever and ever.
Peter	Amen.
Peter	By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.
Peter	The [church that is] at Babylon, elected together with [you], saluteth you; and [so doth] Marcus my son.
Peter	Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity.
Peter	Peace [be] with you all that are in Christ Jesus.
Peter	Amen.
Peter	Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:
Peter	Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,
Peter	According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that [pertain] unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:
Peter	Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.
Peter	And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;
Peter	And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
Peter	And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.
Peter	For if these things be in you, and abound, they make [you that ye shall] neither [be] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Peter	But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.
Peter	Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:
Peter	For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
Peter	Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know [them], and be established in the present truth.
Peter	Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting [you] in remembrance;
Peter	Knowing that shortly I must put off [this] my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.
Peter	Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.
Peter	For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
Peter	For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
Peter	And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.
Peter	We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:
Peter	Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
Peter	For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake [as they were] moved by the Holy Ghost.
Peter	But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.
Peter	And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.
Peter	And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.
Peter	For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast [them] down to hell, and delivered [them] into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;
Peter	And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth [person], a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;
Peter	And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned [them] with an overthrow, making [them] an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;
Peter	And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:
Peter	(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed [his] righteous soul from day to day with [their] unlawful deeds;)
James	James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
James	My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
James	Knowing [this], that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
James	But let patience have [her] perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
James	If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all [men] liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
James	But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.
James	For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
James	For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
James	A double minded man [is] unstable in all his ways.
James	Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
James	But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
James	For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
James	Blessed [is] the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.
James	Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:
James	But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.
James	Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.
James	Do not err, my beloved brethren.
James	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
James	Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
James	Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
James	For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
James	Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
James	But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
James	For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:
James	For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
James	But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth [therein], he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.
James	If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion [is] vain.
James	Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, [and] to keep himself unspotted from the world.
James	My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [the Lord] of glory, with respect of persons.
James	For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;
James	And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:
James	Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?
James	Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?
James	But ye have despised the poor.
James	Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?
James	Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?
James	If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:
James	But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.
James	For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one [point], he is guilty of all.
James	For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill.
James	Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
James	So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
James	For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.
James	What [doth it] profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works?
James	can faith save him?
James	If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
James	And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be [ye] warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what [doth it] profit?
James	Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.
James	Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.
James	Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.
James	But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
James	Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
James	Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?
James	And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.
James	Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.
James	Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent [them] out another way?
James	For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
James	My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.
James	For in many things we offend all.
James	If any man offend not in word, the same [is] a perfect man, [and] able also to bridle the whole body.
James	Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.
James	Behold also the ships, which though [they be] so great, and [are] driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.
James	Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things.
James	Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!
James	And the tongue [is] a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.
James	For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:
James	But the tongue can no man tame; [it is] an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
James	Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.
James	Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing.
James	My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
James	Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet [water] and bitter?
James	Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries?
James	either a vine, figs?
James	so [can] no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.
James	Who [is] a wise man and endued with knowledge among you?
James	let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.
James	But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.
James	This wisdom descendeth not from above, but [is] earthly, sensual, devilish.
James	For where envying and strife [is], there [is] confusion and every evil work.
James	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, [and] easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.
James	And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.
James	From whence [come] wars and fightings among you?
James	[come they] not hence, [even] of your lusts that war in your members?
James	Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.
James	Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume [it] upon your lusts.
James	Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?
James	whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
James	Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?
James	But he giveth more grace.
James	Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.
James	Submit yourselves therefore to God.
James	Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
James	Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.
James	Cleanse [your] hands, [ye] sinners; and purify [your] hearts, [ye] double minded.
James	Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and [your] joy to heaviness.
James	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.
James	Speak not evil one of another, brethren.
James	He that speaketh evil of [his] brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
James	There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?
James	Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:
James	Whereas ye know not what [shall be] on the morrow.
James	For what [is] your life?
James	It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.
James	For that ye [ought] to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.
James	But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.
James	Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth [it] not, to him it is sin.
James	Go to now, [ye] rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon [you].
Jude	Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, [and] called:
Jude	Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.
Jude	Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort [you] that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.
Jude	For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.
Jude	I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.
Jude	And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
Jude	Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.
Jude	Likewise also these [filthy] dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.
Jude	Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.
Jude	But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.
Jude	Woe unto them!
Jude	for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.
Jude	These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds [they are] without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
Jude	Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.
Jude	And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,
Jude	To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard [speeches] which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.
Jude	These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling [words], having men’s persons in admiration because of advantage.
Jude	But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
Jude	How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.
Jude	These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.
Jude	But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,
